# Thinking out of the box

## Occam's Razor
***The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.***

## A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

## Know Our Goal

 **There is something called the "10,000-Hour Rule," which explains that you need to spend 10,000 hours on becoming good at something. We do not want to spend 10,000 hours learning a skill.
When we research this rule a bit, we will find a TEDx talk by Josh Kaufman in which he explains it more in-depth. He proposes that we can learn something new in 20 hours, even working on it for just 45 minutes per day. This sounds much more attainable! At this point, we also should think about the Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule.**

**The Pareto principle states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. Conversely, this means that with 80% of the effort, we can achieve the remaining 20% of the effect, which is 100% missing. However, it is essential to note that it does not apply to everything but is a general rule applied to specific areas.**

## Efficiency depends not only on the quality of information we find but on the usage of that information.

## Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning. 

## Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions. Everything else is only assumptions.
