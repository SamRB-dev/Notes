**Prompt**: Create detail oriented notes on the following statistical concepts with definition, simple explanation, formulas and their representations, use cases, pros and cons. For each concepts there should be at least two mathematical examples with step by step process.
### 1. Mean (Arithmetic Mean)

**Definition**: The mean is the average of a set of numbers, found by dividing the sum of all numbers in the set by the count of numbers.

**Formula**: 
$\[ \text{Mean} = \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \]$

**Example**:
- **Data**: 5, 10, 15
- **Calculation**: (5 + 10 + 15) / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10
- **Mean**: 10

**Use Cases**: Understanding overall trends, such as average temperature or average sales.

**Pros**: Simple to understand and calculate.

**Cons**: Can be misleading if data is skewed by outliers.

### 2. Weighted Mean

**Definition**: The weighted mean considers the weight associated with each value, giving more importance to certain values.

**Formula**: 
$\[ \text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \]$

**Example**:
- **Data**: Exam scores = 80, 90, 70; Weights (Credit Hours) = 3, 4, 2
- **Calculation**: (80\*3 + 90\*4 + 70\*2) / (3 + 4 + 2) = 610 / 9 = 67.78
- **Weighted Mean**: 67.78

**Use Cases**: Calculating GPA, where courses have different credit weights.

**Pros**: Accounts for varying importance of each value.

**Cons**: Requires meaningful weights, which can be subjective.

### 3. Median

**Definition**: The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.

**Formula**: For an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number. For an even number, it is the average of the two middle numbers.

**Example**:
- **Odd Count Data**: 1, 3, 5 → Median = 3
- **Even Count Data**: 2, 4, 6, 8 → Median = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5

**Use Cases**: Real estate prices, where outliers (extremely high or low prices) might skew the mean.

**Pros**: Not affected by outliers.

**Cons**: Does not consider the value of all data points.

### 4. Percentile

**Definition**: The nth percentile is a value below which n percent of observations fall.

**Formula**: 
$\[ P_k = X\left(\frac{k}{100} \times N\right) \]$
Where \(P_k\) is the \(k\)th percentile, \(N\) is the number of observations, and \(X\) is the sorted data.

**Example**:
- **Data**: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50; **25th Percentile** (Q1)
- **Calculation**: 25% of 5 = 1.25 → interpolate between 1st and 2nd values → 15
- **25th Percentile**: 15

**Use Cases**: Test scores, income distribution.

**Pros**: Useful for understanding distribution and outliers.

**Cons**: Calculation can be ambiguous with small datasets or discrete data.

### 5. Weighted Median

**Definition**: Similar to the median but in datasets where values have different weights.

**Example & Calculation**: This concept doesn't have a simple universal formula like the mean, as it depends on ordering the weighted observations and finding the middle point based on cumulative weights.

**Use Cases**: Economics (e.g., weighted median income).

### 6. Trimmed Mean

**Definition**: A mean calculated after "trimming" or removing fixed percentages of the largest and smallest values.

**Formula**: Remove a percentage of data points from both ends and then calculate the mean of the remaining data.

**Example**:
- **Data**: 1, 2, 2, 3, 100 (Trim 20%)
- **Trimmed Data**: 2, 2, 3
- **Trimmed Mean**: (2 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.33

**Use Cases**: Reducing the effect of extreme outliers.

**Pros**: More robust than the mean.

**Cons**: Choosing the percentage to trim can be arbitrary.

### 7. Robustness

**Definition**: Statistical measures or methods are considered robust if they are not significantly affected by outliers or violations of model assumptions.

**Example**: The median is more robust than the mean, as it is less affected by extreme values.

**Use Cases**: Data with outliers, non-normal distributions.



### 8. Outlier

**Definition**: An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.

**Example**:
- **Data**: 2, 2, 3, 3, 99
- **Outlier Detection**: 99 is an outlier.

**Use Cases**: Fraud detection, anomaly detection.

**Pros**: Identifying outliers can reveal data entry errors or interesting anomalies.

**Cons**: Handling outliers (e.g., removing them) can sometimes lead to loss of valuable information.

Creating detailed notes on the specified statistical concepts:

### 1. Deviation
- **Definition**: The difference between an observed value and the overall mean of a dataset.
- **Formula**: $\( d_i = x_i - \bar{x} \)$
  - Where $\( x_i \)$ is an observed value and $\( \bar{x} \)$ is the mean of the dataset.
- **Use Cases**: Understanding how data points vary from the mean.
- **Pros and Cons**: Simple to calculate, but can be misleading if used alone since positive and negative deviations may cancel out.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 2, 4, 6, 8
  - Mean $(\( \bar{x} \)): 5$
  - Deviations: -3, -1, 1, 3

### 2. Standard Deviation
- **Definition**: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.
- **Formula**: $\( \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \)$
- **Use Cases**: Assessing the spread of a dataset; high standard deviation indicates data is spread out.
- **Pros and Cons**: Provides a clear measure of spread, but sensitive to outliers.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 2, 4, 6, 8
  - Mean $(\( \bar{x} \))$: 5
  - Variance $(\( \sigma^2 \))$: 5
  - Standard Deviation $(\( \sigma \)): \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.24 \)$

### 3. Variance
- **Definition**: The average of the squared deviations from the Mean.
- **Formula**: $\( \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N} \)$
- **Use Cases**: Quantifying the spread of data points.
- **Pros and Cons**: Gives a squared dimension, which can be hard to interpret.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 2, 4, 6, 8
  - Mean $(\( \bar{x} \))$: 5
  - Variance $(\( \sigma^2 \))$: 5

### 4. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- **Definition**: The average of the absolute deviations from the Mean.
- **Formula**: $\( MAD = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |x_i - \bar{x}| \)$
- **Use Cases**: Describing variability; less sensitive to outliers compared to standard deviation.
- **Pros and Cons**: Easier to interpret than variance, but may not reflect variability as effectively as the standard deviation.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 2, 4, 6, 8
  - Mean $(\( \bar{x} \))$: 5
  - MAD: 2

### 5. Median Absolute Deviation from the Median (MAD Median)
- **Definition**: The median of the absolute deviations from the dataset's median.
- **Formula**: $\( MAD_{\text{median}} = \text{median}(|x_i - \text{median}(x)|) \)$
- **Use Cases**: Robust measure of variability; particularly useful with skewed distributions or outliers.
- **Pros and Cons**: Highly robust against outliers, but less intuitive to some users.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
  - Median: 4
  - MAD Median: 2

### 6. Range
- **Definition**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{Range} = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}} \)$
- **Use Cases**: Quick assessment of data spread.
- **Pros and Cons**: Simple to calculate but doesn’t give information about the distribution between min and max.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
  - Range: 9 - 1 = 8

### 7. Order Statistics
- **Definition**: The statistics that provide information about the ranks of data points within a dataset, such as the minimum, maximum, or any other percentile.
- **Use Cases**: Understanding distribution properties; finding outliers.
- **Pros and Cons**: Useful for non-parametric analysis but can be computationally intensive for large datasets.

### 8. Percentile
- **Definition**: The value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
- **Formula**: For the p-th percentile, order data and find the position $\( n = \frac{p}{100} \times N \)$.
- **Use Cases**: Grading systems, income distribution studies.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
  - 50th Percentile (Median): 4

### 9. Interquartile Range (IQR)
- **Definition**: The difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) in a dataset, representing the middle 50% of the data.
- **Formula**: \( IQR = Q3 - Q1 \)
- **Use Cases**: Identifying outliers, understanding data spread.
- **Pros and Cons**: Not affected by outliers, but ignores the tails of the distribution.
- **Example**:
  - Data: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
  - Q1: 2, Q3: 6
  - IQR: 6 - 2 = 4

Each of these statistical concepts plays a crucial role in data analysis, offering different insights into the distribution, spread, and central tendency of the data. Understanding and applying these concepts appropriately can enhance the analysis and modeling process in any machine learning project.
