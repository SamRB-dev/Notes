Different mathematical notations are used to explicitly include or exclude zero, as well as to distinguish between positive and negative numbers in various number sets. Here are some common variations:

1. **Natural Numbers (ℕ)**:
   - $\( \mathbb{N} \):$ Typically used to represent the set of positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).
   - $\( \mathbb{N}_0 \)$ or $\( \mathbb{N}^0 \)$: Used to include zero, representing the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

2. **Integers (ℤ)**:
   - $\( \mathbb{Z} \)$: Represents all integers, both positive and negative, including zero.
   - $\( \mathbb{Z}^+ \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \)$: Represents the set of positive integers.
   - $\( \mathbb{Z}^- \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Z}_{<0} \)$: Represents the set of negative integers.
   - $\( \mathbb{Z}^* \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Z}_{\neq 0} \)$: Represents all integers except zero.

3. **Rational Numbers (ℚ)**:
   - $\( \mathbb{Q} \)$: Represents all rational numbers (fractions and integers).
   - $\( \mathbb{Q}^+ \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \)$: Represents positive rational numbers.
   - $\( \mathbb{Q}^- \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Q}_{<0} \)$: Represents negative rational numbers.
   - $\( \mathbb{Q}^* \)$ or $\( \mathbb{Q}_{\neq 0} \)$: Represents all rational numbers except zero.

4. **Real Numbers (ℝ)**:
   - $\( \mathbb{R} \)$: Represents all real numbers (includes rational and irrational numbers).
   - $\( \mathbb{R}^+ \)$ or $\( \mathbb{R}_{>0} \)$: Represents positive real numbers.
   - $\( \mathbb{R}^- \)$ or $\( \mathbb{R}_{<0} \)$: Represents negative real numbers.
   - $\( \mathbb{R}^* \)$ or $\( \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0} \)$: Represents all real numbers except zero.

5. **Complex Numbers (ℂ)**:
   - $\( \mathbb{C} \)$: Represents all complex numbers.
   - There aren't typically specific symbols to denote subsets of complex numbers like only positive or negative, as complex numbers include a real and an imaginary part.

These notations are widely used in mathematical texts and literature. It's important to note that there might be some variations depending on the source or the context in which these symbols are used.
