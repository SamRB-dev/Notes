## Logarithms
---
Here's a list of key logarithmic formulas:

1. **Definition of a Logarithm**: 
   - $\( \log_b(x) = y \) if and only if \( b^y = x \).$ 
   - This is the fundamental definition of a logarithm.

2. **Change of Base Formula**: 
   - $\( \log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)} \).$
   - This formula allows you to convert a logarithm from one base to another.

3. **Product Rule (Logarithm of a Product)**: 
   - $\( \log_b(MN) = \log_b(M) + \log_b(N) \).$
   - The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.

4. **Quotient Rule (Logarithm of a Quotient)**: 
   - $\( \log_b\left(\frac{M}{N}\right) = \log_b(M) - \log_b(N) \).$
   - The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms.

5. **Power Rule (Logarithm of a Power)**: 
   - $\( \log_b(M^p) = p \cdot \log_b(M) \).$
   - The logarithm of a power is the exponent times the logarithm.

6. **Logarithm of 1**: 
   - $\( \log_b(1) = 0 \)$.
   - The logarithm of 1 in any base is 0 because any base raised to the power of 0 is 1.

7. **Logarithm of the Base**: 
   - $\( \log_b(b) = 1 \).$
   - The logarithm of the base itself is always 1.

8. **Logarithm of a Negative Number**: 
   - Logarithms of negative numbers are undefined in the real number system.

9. **Natural Logarithm (ln)**: 
   - $\( \ln(x) \)$ is equivalent to $\( \log_e(x) \)$, where $\( e \)$ is Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.71828.

10. when you take the natural logarithm of an exponential function, you can apply the property: $ln‚Å°(e^y) = y$

These formulas are fundamental in solving logarithmic equations and manipulating logarithmic expressions. Understanding how to apply these rules is key in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics. 

## Exponents and Roots
---
Here's a list of important formulas for exponents and roots, which are fundamental in algebra and higher-level mathematics:

### Exponent Formulas

1. **Product Rule**: 
   - $\( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \)$
   - When multiplying two powers with the same base, add their exponents.

2. **Quotient Rule**:
   - $\( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \) (for \( a \neq 0 \))$
   - When dividing two powers with the same base, subtract the exponents.

3. **Power of a Power Rule**:
   - $\( (a^m)^n = a^{mn} \)$
   - When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents.

4. **Power of a Product Rule**:
   - $\( (ab)^n = a^n \cdot b^n \)$
   - When raising a product to a power, raise each factor to the power.

5. **Power of a Quotient Rule**:
   - $\( \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n} \) (for \( b \neq 0 \))$
   - When raising a quotient to a power, raise both the numerator and the denominator to the power.

6. **Zero Exponent Rule**:
   - $\( a^0 = 1 \) (for \( a \neq 0 \))$
   - Any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

7. **Negative Exponent Rule**:
   - $\( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \) (for \( a \neq 0 \))$
   - A negative exponent indicates reciprocal of the base raised to the absolute value of the exponent.

### Root Formulas

1. **Definition of a Root**:
   - A number b is an n-th root of a if and only if $\( b^n = a \)$
   - The \( n \)-th root of \( a \) is \( b \) if \( b \) raised to the \( n \)-th power equals \( a \).

2. **Product Property of Roots**:
   - $\( \sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b} \)$
   - The \( n \)-th root of a product is equal to the product of the \( n \)-th roots of each factor.

3. **Quotient Property of Roots**:
   - $\( \sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}} \) (for \( b \neq 0 \))$
   - The \( n \)-th root of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the \( n \)-th roots of the numerator and denominator.

4. **Rational Exponents**:
   - $\( a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} \) or \( (\sqrt[n]{a})^m \)$
   - A rational exponent represents a root; the denominator of the exponent is the root degree.

5. **Power Rule for Roots**:
   - $\( (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m} \)$
   - The power of a root can be taken either before or after taking the root.

Listing all formulas related to roots is quite extensive, as there are many types and applications in mathematics. However, I'll provide a general overview of the most commonly used root formulas, covering both numerical and algebraic roots:

### Numerical Roots

1. **Square Root**:
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( r \) such that $\( r^2 = x \).$
   - Formula: $\( r = \sqrt{x} \)$.

2. **Cube Root**:
   - The cube root of a number \( x \) is a number \( r \) such that $\( r^3 = x \)$.
   - Formula: $\( r = \sqrt[3]{x} \)$.

3. **\( n^{th} \) Root**:
   - The \( n^{th} \) root of a number \( x \) is a number \( r \) such that \( r^n = x \).
   - Formula: $\( r = \sqrt[n]{x} \)$.

### Roots of Polynomials

For polynomial equations, the roots are the solutions to the equation \( p(x) = 0 \). Here are some common formulas:

1. **Linear Equation** $(\( ax + b = 0 \))$:
   - Root: $\( x = -\frac{b}{a} \)$.


2. **Quadratic Equation** $(\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \))$:
   - Roots: $\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)$.

3. **Cubic Equations** and higher-degree polynomials have more complex formulas for roots and often require numerical methods or specific factorization for solutions.

### Special Formulas

1. **Roots of Unity**:
   - In complex numbers, the $\( n^{th} \)$ roots of unity are solutions to $\( x^n = 1 \)$.
   - They are given by $\( x_k = \cos\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 \)$.

2. **Nested Square Roots** or other nested roots often require specific methods for simplification.

### Miscellaneous

- **Operations with Roots**: Various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) involving roots have their own set of rules and formulas, especially when simplifying expressions with square roots or cube roots.
- **Approximations**: For complex roots or roots of higher-degree polynomials, numerical methods like Newton-Raphson or approximation formulas are used.

This list is not exhaustive, as there are many specialized formulas depending on the context and the specific mathematical field. However, these cover the most commonly encountered types of roots in general mathematics.
