In addition to statistics and probability, here are some important math concepts that are commonly used in machine learning:

1. **Linear Algebra:**
   - Vectors and vector operations
   - Matrices and matrix operations
   - Dot product and matrix multiplication
   - Matrix inverse and determinant
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

2. **Calculus:**
   - Differentiation and derivatives
   - Gradient and partial derivatives
   - Optimization techniques like gradient descent
   - Integration and integral calculus

3. **Optimization:**
   - Objective functions and optimization problems
   - Convex and non-convex optimization
   - Optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, Adam)

4. **Linear Regression:**
   - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
   - Cost function and loss minimization
   - Gradient descent for parameter estimation

5. **Matrix Decomposition:**
   - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Eigenvalue decomposition

6. **Probability Distributions:**
   - Gaussian (Normal) distribution
   - Bernoulli distribution
   - Binomial distribution
   - Poisson distribution

7. **Graph Theory:**
   - Graph representation and properties
   - Network analysis and algorithms (e.g., PageRank)

8. **Information Theory:**
   - Entropy and information content
   - Mutual Information
   - Kullback-Leibler Divergence

9. **Decision Theory:**
   - Bayes' theorem and Bayesian inference
   - Decision trees and decision-making processes
   - Utility theory and expected utility

10. **Numerical Methods:**
    - Root-finding algorithms (e.g., Newton's method)
    - Numerical integration techniques (e.g., Simpson's rule)
    - Interpolation and extrapolation

While it's not necessary to have an in-depth understanding of all these concepts before starting with machine learning, having a good grasp of them will certainly be beneficial for advanced ML techniques, algorithm development, and understanding the underlying mathematical principles behind various ML models.
