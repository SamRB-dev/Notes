**Book**: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2rd Edition
# Definitions 
**Arthur Samuel (1959)**: Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

**Tom Mitchell (1997)**: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

### Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Batch/Offline Learning
- Online Learning

**Learning Rate**: Speed of a model's ability to learn from data.

**There are two main approaches to generalization.**
- **instance-based learning**: the system learns the examples by
heart, then generalizes to new cases by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples (or a subset of them).

- model-based learning.

**Challenges of ML**:
- Insufficient Quality Training Data
- Nonrepresentative Training Data
- Poor Quality Data
- Irrelevant Features
- Overfitting and Underfitting
