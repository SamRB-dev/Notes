df = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Basic info about the dataset
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

# Univariate Analysis
plt.hist(df['mileage'])
plt.title('Mileage Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Mileage')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Bivariate Analysis
sns.scatterplot(x='mileage', y='price', data=df)
plt.title('Price vs Mileage')
plt.show()

# Check for correlations
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)

**Your data should drive your choice of an ML algorithm.**

***
When dealing with columns that have more than two unique values (i.e., categorical variables with multiple categories), you have a few options for handling them in your machine learning model. Here are some common approaches:

1. **One-Hot Encoding**: One-Hot Encoding is a technique that represents each category in a binary format. It creates new binary columns (also known as dummy variables), one for each category in the original column. The value 1 is assigned to the corresponding category, and 0 is assigned to all other categories. This approach allows the model to understand and utilize the categorical information effectively. Many machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, provide built-in functions for one-hot encoding.

2. **Label Encoding**: Label Encoding is another technique where each category is assigned a unique numerical label. It replaces the categories with integers. However, it's important to note that label encoding assigns arbitrary numerical values, which may introduce unintended ordinal relationships between categories. This can mislead the model into assuming a meaningful order where none exists. Label encoding is typically used for ordinal variables where there is an inherent order or rank.

3. **Ordinal Encoding**: Ordinal Encoding is a variant of label encoding that assigns numerical labels to categories based on their order or rank. This encoding is suitable for variables with a natural ordering, such as education levels (e.g., "high school," "college," "graduate"). Ordinal encoding ensures that the model can capture the relative differences between categories accurately.

4. **Count Encoding**: Count Encoding replaces each category with the count of occurrences of that category in the dataset. This encoding method can be useful when the frequency or occurrence of a category carries valuable information. However, it may not work well for rare categories that have limited occurrences.

5. **Target Encoding**: Target Encoding, also known as mean encoding or likelihood encoding, replaces each category with the mean (or some other statistical measure) of the target variable for that category. This encoding can be helpful when the target variable shows significant variation across categories. However, it may be prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with small or imbalanced datasets.

The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of your data, the number of unique categories, and the specific requirements of your machine learning model. It's essential to consider the potential impact of encoding on your model's performance, interpretability, and the underlying assumptions of the encoding technique.

Correlation analysis is a valuable technique in machine learning for several reasons:

1. **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis helps in identifying the relationships between variables. By calculating the correlation coefficients between features and the target variable, you can determine which features have a strong influence on the target. This information can guide you in selecting the most relevant features for your model, improving its performance and reducing overfitting.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Correlation analysis provides insights into the relationships between different features. It helps in identifying redundant or highly correlated features that may not provide additional information. By removing or combining such features, you can simplify the model, reduce dimensionality, and improve interpretability.

3. **Data Understanding**: Correlation analysis helps in understanding the dependencies and interactions between variables in your dataset. It provides a quantitative measure of how variables move together, either positively or negatively. This understanding can help you gain insights into the underlying data patterns and guide further data exploration and model development.

4. **Detecting Multicollinearity**: Correlation analysis helps in identifying multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more features are highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can negatively impact model performance and interpretation, leading to unstable coefficients and inflated standard errors. By identifying and addressing multicollinearity, you can improve the reliability and stability of your model.

5. **Visualizing Relationships**: Correlation analysis can be visualized using correlation matrices or heatmaps, which provide a clear overview of the relationships between variables. Visualizations help in identifying patterns, clusters, or groups of variables that are strongly correlated or independent. This visual representation aids in data exploration and communication of results.

It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While correlation analysis provides insights into the relationships between variables, it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, it's crucial to interpret the results of correlation analysis in conjunction with domain knowledge and further statistical analysis to draw meaningful conclusions and make informed decisions in machine learning.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering involves transforming and creating new features from the existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models. It includes techniques like one-hot encoding, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and creating interaction or polynomial features.

5. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for further analysis or model training. It involves handling missing values, outlier detection and treatment, data normalization or standardization, encoding categorical variables, and handling imbalanced data.

6. **Time Series Analysis:** Time series analysis is used when working with data that changes over time. It involves techniques such as trend analysis, seasonality analysis, forecasting, autocorrelation, and decomposition of time series data.

7. **Text Analysis/Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text analysis and NLP techniques are used to extract insights from textual data. It includes tasks like text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal), sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and named entity recognition.

8. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information. This helps in reducing computational complexity and overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are commonly used.

9. **Model Evaluation and Validation:** ML engineers need to evaluate and validate the performance of their models. This involves techniques such as cross-validation, evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve), bias-variance tradeoff analysis, and understanding overfitting and underfitting.

10. **Model Interpretability:** ML engineers should have an understanding of techniques to interpret and explain their models' predictions. This includes feature importance analysis, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and model-agnostic interpretability methods.

These are some of the key types of data analysis that ML engineers should be familiar with. However, it's important to note that the specific types of analysis may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the data being analyzed.
