Here are some beginner-friendly machine learning projects that will help you learn the basic and most common ML algorithms:

1. **Iris Flower Classification**: Develop a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. This project allows you to practice classification algorithms like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees.

2. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Build a model to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. This project involves classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest.

3. **Boston Housing Price Prediction**: Create a regression model to predict the prices of houses in Boston based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. This project allows you to practice regression algorithms like linear regression and decision trees.

4. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Develop a model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This project allows you to explore algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN).

5. **Breast Cancer Classification**: Build a model to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant based on various features. This project involves practicing classification algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, and decision trees.

6. **Diabetes Onset Prediction**: Create a model to predict the onset of diabetes based on medical attributes like glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc. This project allows you to explore classification algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, and naive Bayes.

7. **Customer Segmentation**: Use clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior or demographic data. This project helps you understand unsupervised learning algorithms.

8. **Movie Genre Classification**: Develop a model to classify movies into different genres based on their descriptions or reviews. This project allows you to practice text classification techniques using algorithms like logistic regression, naive Bayes, or support vector machines.

Remember to start with a clear understanding of the problem, explore and preprocess the dataset, train and evaluate the models, and interpret the results. As you work on these projects, you will gain hands-on experience with various ML algorithms and develop a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
